You will not need to provide any information regarding your emissions tests results at the time of registration.\nNo vehicle subject to an emissions inspection will be registered or reregistered by DMV until it has passed an emissions inspection or has been issued an emissions inspection waiver due to repair costs that exceed a repair cost threshold.\nTo find out fees and other information about the emission inspection program, please contact the\nVirginia Department of Environmental Quality\nat 703-583-3900 or toll-free in Virginia at 1-800-275-3844.\nExemptions\nIf your vehicle is being registered for the first time in Virginia and has a current valid emissions certificate (performed in the last 12 months), it may be titled and registered without a Virginia emissions inspection.\nMotor vehicles exempt from emissions inspections include:\nMotorcycles\nAutocycle: a three-wheeled motor vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does not require the operator to straddle or sit astride and is manufactured to comply with federal safety requirements for motorcycles.

Although exempt from the emissions inspection, the $2 emissions fee is required when renewing these registrations.\nGasoline powered passenger or property carrying vehicles with a manufacturer's designated gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds.\nDiesel powered vehicles\nNote:\nDiesel powered vehicles are NOT exempt from the emissions testing program requirements when they have:\nA model year newer than 1996, and\nA Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) less than 8,501 lbs., (if GVWR is not available, empty and gross weights will be used) and\nA registration that expires in July 2007 or later.\nVehicles EXCLUSIVELY powered by clean fuel, including compressed or liquified natural gas, electricity, or solar energy\nNew or demonstrator vehicles being titled for the first time are exempt from emissions inspections for 4 years.\nUsed vehicles of the current and three previous model years are exempt from emissions inspections for up to 4 years.\nQualified hybrid motor vehicles are subject to the $2 per year emissions fee when renewing the vehicle registration as required by the DEQ, Virginia Code \u00a7\n46.2-1182.1\n.\nEmissions Inspections and Vehicle Registrations\nTo avoid delays in obtaining your vehicle registration from DMV, have your emissions inspection completed before you apply to DMV for registration.\nCheck the expiration date of the existing emissions inspection certificate to ensure that there is sufficient time remaining to allow for an original, renewed, or transferred registration.\nTo register or renew for 1 year or to transfer license plates, there must be more than 3 months validity remaining before the expiration date of the emissions inspection certificate.\nTo register or renew for 2 years, there must be at least 15 months validity remaining before the expiration date of the emissions inspection certificate.\nTo register or renew for 3 years, there must be at least 27 months validity remaining before the expiration date of the emissions inspection certificate.\nDon't forget, you can renew your vehicle registration via the\nInternet\n, by\nmail\nor at any\ncustomer service center\n.\nIf needed, a one-month registration extension may be requested in person at a DMV\ncustomer service center\nor\nDMV Select\nlocation. This extension will allow you to drive legally for one additional month, in order to obtain the required emissions inspection. A $10 administrative fee will be charged and prorated registration fees will be collected for the one-month registration period.

Depending on how you plan to use your vehicle, you may choose antique, vintage or any one of our standard license plates.\nAntique license plates are provided by DMV, while vintage license plates are original Virginia license plates issued before 1976 that you provide. Antique vehicles must be\ninsured\nwith motor vehicle liability insurance. Virginia requires the\nminimum coverage limits\nset forth in the Code of Virginia \u00a7\n46.2-472\n.\nPassenger vehicles and trailers manufactured in or after 1973 are not eligible to use vintage license plates, as DMV began issuing yearly decals for passenger vehicles and trailers in 1973. You will only be able to use antique or standard license plates issued by DMV on those vehicles.\nIf you own a motorcycle, you may be able to provide vintage motorcycle plates that were issued up to 1976. If your motorcycle was manufactured in or after 1976, you must use either antique or standard license plates issued by DMV.\nUsing Your Antique Vehicle Just For Show\nIf you plan to use your antique vehicle or trailer solely as a collector's item, you may register your vehicle with antique license plates or permanent vintage license plates.\nRegistering your vehicle either of these ways limits your use of the vehicle to:\nParticipation in antique car club activities, exhibits, tours, parades and similar events.\nTesting its operation, obtaining repairs or maintenance, selling the vehicle or trailer, transportation to and from events as described above and for the occasional pleasure driving, not to exceed 250 miles from your residence.\nCarrying or transporting passengers, personal effects or other antique motor vehicles being transported for show purposes.\nYou may not use your vehicle for general, daily transportation. This includes, but is not limited to, driving to and from work.\nIf you are providing vintage license plates, then the year embossed on the license plate must match the model year of the vehicle. Additionally, DMV must inspect and approve the physical condition of the vintage plates.\nTo register your vehicle with antique or permanent vintage license plates, DMV charges a one-time $50 registration fee. Use the Vehicle Registration Application (\nVSA 14\n) or the License Plate Application (\nVSA 10\n), and the Antique Vehicle Applicant Certification (\nVSA 10B\n).\nYour license plates will be valid for as long as you own the vehicle.\nYou may not transfer your license plates to another vehicle, but you may surrender them to DMV and then register them to a different vehicle for an additional fee.\nUnless the vehicle was manufactured for one license plate only, you must display license plates on the front and the rear of your vehicle.\nUsing the Antique Vehicle Applicant Certification (\nVSA 10B\n), you must also certify that you own, or have regular use of, another vehicle, without antique plates, for daily use and that the vehicle or trailer you want to register with antique plates can be driven safely on Virginia highways.\nUsing Your Antique Vehicle For Everyday Driving\nIn order to enjoy unrestricted driving privileges in your antique vehicle, you'll need to either:\nPurchase standard license plates (not antique plates) from DMV or\nProvide vintage license plates AND register your antique vehicle for general transportation purposes.\nNo matter which option you choose, you will be subject to the same\nregistration requirements\n. So if you choose to use vintage license plates, just like owning a modern vehicle, you'll have to:\nRenew your vehicle registration every year or every other year (depending on whether you renew for one or two years), pay the same registration fee you would pay to purchase standard license plates.\nDisplay month and year decals on your vintage license plates.\nObtain an annual safety inspection sticker for your vehicle.\nIf you own another vehicle or trailer of the same model year, you may transfer your general transportation vintage license plates to that vehicle.\nViolations of the antique vehicle rules are Class 4 misdemeanors and will result in the revocation of your antique or permanent vintage license plates for a period of five years from the date DMV is notified of your conviction.\nAdditional Information\nFor more details about the use of antique or vintage license plates, visit Virginia Code Section\n46.2-730\n.",

This is a result of the Vehicle Registration Withholding program in which the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) assists government entities in collecting delinquent revenue.\nDMV will notify you by mail if it has received notification from another entity that you have outstanding payments due. It is your responsibility to contact the entity that reported the outstanding amount, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nOne-Month Registration Extension\nIf needed, a one-time, one-month registration extension may be requested in person at a DMV\ncustomer service center\nor\nDMV Select\nlocation. This extension will allow you to drive legally for one additional month, while you satisfy the requirements of the locality. A $10 administrative fee will be charged for the extension and prorated registration fees will be collected for the one-month registration period. In order to be eligible, your vehicle registration must be valid and due to expire within the current calendar month.\nPersonal Property Taxes and Vehicle Licensing Fees\nIf you have been reported as having delinquent tangible personal property taxes or unpaid local vehicle licensing fees, your city, county, or town can prevent the reissuance or renewal of registrations for all vehicles you own and co-own. If you are affected, it is your responsibility to contact the local Treasurer or Director of Finance that reported the delinquent account to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nParking Tickets\nIf you have unpaid parking tickets, localities can prevent the reissuance or renewal of registration for the vehicle that incurred the citation. If you are affected, it is your responsibility to contact the locality that reported the unpaid citations to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nToll Violations\nIf you have received an invoice for two or more unpaid tolls, toll facility operators can restrict the reissuance or renewal of registration for the vehicle involved in the toll violation.\nNot operating your vehicle at time of offense?\nAs the registered owner of the vehicle, it is your responsibility to contest liability if you were not operating the vehicle at the time of offense. If you fail to pay the unpaid tolls and administrative fees or fail to file a notice to contest liability, the toll facility operator can prevent reissuance or renewal of the vehicle registration.\nNot the owner of the vehicle at time of offense?\nIf you were driving a vehicle you did not own when you committed the offense, the registered owner of the vehicle can contest liability. In this case, you may have been reported as the driver of the vehicle when the offense was committed. If the tolls and fees remain unpaid and you have been identified by the court as the driver of the vehicle, you will not be reissued or allowed renewal of registrations for all vehicles you own and co-own.\nIf you are affected by this program, it is your responsibility to contact the\ntoll facility\noperator that reported the unpaid tolls to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.",

            "text_content": "A state-owned vehicle is a vehicle owned by a government agency and used for official state business. Some processes and requirements are different for state-owned vehicles than for personal vehicles.\nTitling and Registering a State-Owned Vehicle\nUnlike personal vehicles, state registrations do not expire and state-owned vehicles must have license plates with a \"state designation.\"\nBecause of these distinctions, when completing the\nApplication for Certificate of Title and Registration\nfor a state-owned vehicle, you must\nselect \"YES\" where it asks \"Is vehicle state or locality owned?\"\nand include the correct state agency code.\nIf the code is incorrect, the vehicle may be excluded from DMV's listing of state-owned vehicles.\nSee\ntitling\nand\nregistering\na vehicle for more information.\nEZFleet and EZReg\nThe EZFleet system allows companies with fleets of 75 or more vehicles to title and register vehicles in Virginia without having to visit a DMV customer service center. In addition to titling and registration,\nEZFleet\nallows you to renew registrations and maintain your fleet vehicle records without ever leaving your office.\nCompanies with fleets between 25 and 74 vehicles are eligible to participate in\nEZReg\n.\nDisposing of a State-Owned Vehicle\nState agencies are prohibited from selling state-owned vehicles. When a state agency wants to dispose of a vehicle, they are required to notify the Virginia Department of General Services (DGS) Office of Surplus Property Management (OSPM). OSPM will coordinate the disposal of the state asset.\nSee\nDGS Rules & Regulations\nfor instructions.\nDGS sells vehicles and other property through auction. After the vehicle is sold, DGS notifies the state agency. In addition, DGS notifies DMV of the change in ownership and requests removal of the vehicle's state registration from DMV's database.\nIf a state agency disposes of a vehicle without contacting DGS, the agency is responsible for notifying DMV. A surplus vehicle remains in the agency's inventory until DMV receives notification it has been sold.\nMonitoring Driver Status\nAnyone operating a state-owned vehicle must have a valid driver's license. For temporary assignments or trip pool use, an employee must show the transportation officer a driver's license before using the vehicle.\nAll state agencies with long-term vehicle assignments should participate in DMV's\nDriver Alert\nprogram offered free to public organizations. Driver Alert notifies employers if their state drivers are exhibiting unsafe driving habits.\nDriver Alert allows the state agency to request:\nImmediate alert of moving violation convictions\nImmediate alert if drivers accumulate seven adverse points within a calendar year\nImmediate alert of suspensions, revocations, disqualifications, reckless driving or driving while intoxicated convictions\nMonth and day you wish to receive annual risk management driver records, which are required for companies who employ drivers with commercial driver's licenses",

This does not include trailers or semi-trailers.\nWhat are the license plate options for MSMVs?\nIf you already have a registered MSMV, you may continue to register for a standard or special license plate for as long as you own the vehicle.\nIf you register an MSMV between July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, you can obtain one of two license plates:\nMilitary surplus license plate \u2013 owner must complete form\nVSA 10M\ncertifying their use of a second vehicle for daily travel and pay a one-time $100 fee. MSMV driving restrictions apply.\nStandard or special license plate \u2013 owner must show proof of a current Virginia safety inspection.\nIf you register a MSMV after December 31, 2018, you are only eligible for military surplus license plates. An owner must complete form\nVSA 10M\nand pay a one-time $100 fee. MSMV driving restrictions apply.\nMSMV driving restrictions\nVirginia Code \u00a7 46.2-730.1 limits MSMV with military surplus license plates to the participation in off-road events, on-road club activities, exhibits, tours, parades, and similar events. MSMV may also be used on the highways of the Commonwealth for the purpose of selling the vehicle and obtaining repairs or maintenance. Military surplus license plates permit occasional pleasure driving (not to exceed 125 miles from the address at which the vehicle is stored for use) but cannot be used for general transportation purposes, including, but not limited to, daily travel to and from the owner\u2019s place of employment. Occasional pleasure driving amounts to a 250 mile round trip.\nViolations of military surplus motor vehicle rules\nAny owner of a MSMV registered with license plates pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-730.1 will be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor if convicted of a violation of military plate usage. The conviction will cause the owner\u2019s registration for the vehicle involved in the violation to be revoked for a five year period from the date of conviction.",
