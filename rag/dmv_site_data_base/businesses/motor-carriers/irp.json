    "text_content": "About IRP\nThe International Registration Plan (IRP) is a method of registering fleets of vehicles that travel in two or more member jurisdictions.\nThe 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, and ten Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan) are members of the Plan.\nNOTE: As of 2019, registration fees increased on property carrying vehicles over 10,000 pounds. All apportioned (IRP) originals and renewals and those supplemental transactions involving increased registration fees are affected. The increase is included in your regular IRP invoice; you will receive a separate DMV billing invoice in the mail.\nFull Reciprocity Plan\nThe IRP member jurisdictions have approved an amendment to change the current IRP fee process to a fee structure known as the Full Reciprocity Plan. The FRP will change the IRP so that all apportioned vehicles are granted full reciprocity in all member jurisdictions.\nFor more information, refer to\nFull Reciprocity Plan (FRP)\n.\nElectronic Credentials\nYou are allowed to carry your IRP cab cards in an electronic image and paper. IRP cab cards are no longer be required.\nAll US States and Canadian Provinces will be required to accept electronic images of IRP cab cards.\nWhen stopped by law enforcement, credentials may be shown as an electronic image on a computer, tablet, or smart phone or as a paper copy. Regardless of the format, the document must be accurate, accessible and readable by law enforcement.\nWe strongly suggest that the document be stored as a PDF on an electronic device in EACH vehicle, to ensure access to documentation while in areas of no service or WiFi. If you are unable to provide proof of credentials, you may be ticketed and required to present proof of registration to a court of law.",
