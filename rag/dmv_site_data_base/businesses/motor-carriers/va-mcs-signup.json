If you have one, great! If not, visit our\nIFTA\nand/or\nIRP\npage for more information.\nNext Steps\nOnce you have an IFTA or IRP account, you\u2019ll need to decide who is going to manage your IFTA and/or IRP fleets within VirginiaMCS.

The person managing the account(s) will need to complete the sign-up process.\nOptions\nThe carrier or an authorized employee of the carrier\nAn agent that will conduct business on behalf of the carrier (for example, an accountant, bookkeeper or other third party)\nOnce you have determined who will manage the account(s) follow the instructions below.\nAccount(s) Managed by the Carrier or Authorized Employee of the Carrier\nIf you are the carrier or authorized employee of the motor carrier, you do not need to complete a formal agreement to become a registered VirginiaMCS user.\nTo set up an account:\nRegister for VirginiaMCS user access by following this\nstep-by-step guide\n.\nNow that you're ready, register as an\nExternal MC Business Customer\n.\nOnce your external user registration access is approved, you will receive emails with temporary login information.
