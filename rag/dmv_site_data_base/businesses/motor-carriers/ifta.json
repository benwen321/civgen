If you are based in Virginia, then:\nYou will apply for motor fuel road tax licensing only in Virginia.\nYou will receive an IFTA license and IFTA decals for your vehicles which will allow you to travel in all other IFTA jurisdictions (for motor fuel road tax purposes only).\nYou will file one tax return every three months with the Virginia DMV for the total tax or refund due for all IFTA jurisdictions. DMV will report your operations to those IFTA jurisdictions for you.\nElectronic Credentials\nYou are to carry your IFTA license in an electronic image. Paper IFTA licenses are no longer required.\nAll US States and Canadian Provinces are required to accept electronic images of IFTA licenses.\nWhen stopped by law enforcement, credentials may be shown as an electronic image on a computer, tablet, or smart phone or as a paper copy.
