    "text_content": "The Unified Carrier Registration program is a state revenue program established under federal law. UCR policies are determined (to the extent not set out in federal law) by a governing board that consists of representatives of participating states, private industry and the federal government. Fees charged under the UCR program are uniform across participating states and set by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation upon the recommendation of the UCR Board.\nThe UCR program is a base-state program. This means, every business subject to UCR requirements, for UCR purposes, would deal only with the state in which it is based\u2014commonly the state in which the business has its principal place of business. Interstate motor carriers of nearly every type are subject to UCR, as are interstate transportation brokers and freight forwarders, and companies that lease or rent rolling stock to interstate carriers.\nEach business subject to UCR is required to register annually with its base state and to pay an annual fee. The fees imposed on motor carriers and freight forwarders\u2014businesses that operate motor vehicles\u2014are assessed on a tier system based on the number of vehicles they have operated. Brokers and leasing companies, which operate no vehicles themselves, are also required to pay a fee at the lowest tier.\nNote: no UCR credential is issued to a UCR registrant. Enforcement is accomplished through online FMCSA data checks and various types of audit.\nAdditional Information\nWho Must Apply\nHow to Apply\nFees\nFrequently Asked Questions\nContact\n(804) 249-5140\nMonday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\nMotor Carrier Services\nP.
