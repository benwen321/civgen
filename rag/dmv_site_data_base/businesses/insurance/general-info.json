    "text_content": "As part of our role administering motor vehicle laws, Virginia DMV monitors liability insurance for motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth.\nTo protect the interests of all Virginia motorists, DMV, in partnership with the insurance industry, administers an Insurance Verification Program to electronically verify the automobile liability insurance on millions of Virginia-registered vehicles and to detect vehicle owners who are not in compliance with insurance requirements. Verification occurs whenever an owner first registers a motor vehicle in Virginia or when a motor vehicle owner or insurance company cancels liability insurance coverage for a vehicle.\nThe goals of the Insurance Verification Program are to:\nEncourage owners of registered motor vehicles to obtain and maintain automobile liability insurance\nIdentify uninsured motor vehicles prior to accident involvement\nReduce paperwork associated with insurance verification process which helps the insurance industry, DMV, and the citizen\nLessen government intrusiveness into the lives of citizens by sending notices only to vehicle owners suspected of being uninsured\nThe Electronic Motor Vehicle Insurance Program, combined with DMV's three other highly successful\ninsurance monitoring methods\nconstitute a highly effective insurance verification program, one in which the citizens of Virginia can be proud.\nBureau of Insurance\nThe State Corporation Commission (SCC) regulates Virginia's businesses and economic concerns balancing the interests of citizens, businesses, stockholders and consumers. The SCC works to assure that Virginians receive quality service from regulated public service businesses at reasonable prices, and assists consumers who have valid disputes with regulated companies.
