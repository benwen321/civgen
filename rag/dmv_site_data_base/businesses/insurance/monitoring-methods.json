    "text_content": "The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) uses the following methods to monitor insurance of Virginia registered vehicles.\nElectronic Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Reporting:\nThis is the cornerstone of all monitoring methods. Code of Virginia \u00a7\n46.2-706.1\nrequires insurance companies authorized or licensed to do business in Virginia to provide liability insurance information to DMV electronically. This information is required when insurance policies are canceled, new policies are written and when there are additions to existing polices for motor vehicles registered in Virginia.\nSuspected Uninsured Accident:\nThis process allows a driver, vehicle owner or a representative to voluntarily\nreport a crash\n, particularly if they have reason to believe that the other vehicle involved in the crash is uninsured.\nLaw Enforcement Notification:\nThis process is initiated when police officers require owners to provide insurance information to DMV. Drivers are issued a form (FR422A) requesting insurance information at roadside checks. DMV issues an order of suspension to vehicle owners who are found uninsured.\nIn addition to the State Police, a total of 108 local law enforcement agencies participate with DMV in the Law Enforcement Notification process.\nPolice Accident Reports (form FR300P):\nThis process utilizes police crash reports to identify potentially uninsured individuals. The crash reports are reviewed to determine if a need exists to request insurance information.\nIf it is determined that a need exists, insurance information is requested from the owner. If the owner fails to respond to the request or if the owner does not have insurance, an order of suspension is issued to the owner.",
