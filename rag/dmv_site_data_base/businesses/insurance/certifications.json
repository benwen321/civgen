The STOP prevents customers from performing any driver transactions (such as renewing a driver's license), but does not affect the customer's ability to register vehicles.\nElectronic Filing\nElectronic filing of financial responsibility certifications with DMV means faster and more efficient service for you and immediate and accurate service for your customer\ns\n.
