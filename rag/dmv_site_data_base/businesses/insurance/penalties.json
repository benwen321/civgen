    "text_content": "Every person applying for registration of a motor vehicle and declaring it to be an insured vehicle, faces stiff penalties if the motor vehicle is later found to be uninsured. In this case, DMV suspends all driver's license and registration certificates and license plates issued to the owner of the motor vehicle. These items are suspended until the person does the following:\nPays a $600 statutory fee (collected by DMV and deposited into the\nUninsured Motorist Fund\n)\nFurnishes and maintains proof of financial responsibility (form SR-22) for three years\nPays a reinstatement fee, if applicable\nDuring the three-year period, insurance companies notify DMV if the insurance coverage is canceled (form SR-26). When three years have elapsed from the effective date of the suspension, DMV relieves the vehicle owner of the requirement of furnishing proof of financial responsibility.\nElectronic Filing\nInsurance companies can file financial responsibility insurance certifications\nelectronically\n. DMV strongly encourages the electronic submissions of the certifications, as this will update your customers' financial responsibility information directly on their DMV record.",
