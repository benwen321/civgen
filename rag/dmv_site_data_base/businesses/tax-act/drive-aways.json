    "text_content": "The Virginia Fuels Tax Act takes some important steps to help stop \"pump-and-runs\" at Virginia retail fuel outlets.\nIndividuals driving away without paying for fuel may forfeit their privilege to drive. Violators, if convicted, face the following:\nFirst offense:\nA fine up to $100 and possible suspension of their driver's license for up to 30 days;\nSecond offense\n: A fine up to $100 and suspension of their driver's license for a period of 30 days.\nThe regulations alone will not curb drive-aways. Signage displayed at or near the pump could help deter this illegal and costly activity. Most importantly, it will take a cooperative effort of the public and private sectors.",
