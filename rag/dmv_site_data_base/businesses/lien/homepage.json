Instead of printing a paper title and mailing it to the lienholder, DMV Headquarters can transmit essential identifying information electronically. Once the lien has been satisfied, the lienholder sends DMV Headquarters an electronic message releasing the title. DMV Headquarters then prints and mails the title to the vehicle owner.\nThis process eliminates much of the paper handling involved in the vehicle titling process. Both parties benefit from lower costs of processing, mailing, filing and retrieving paper.\nTo find out how to become a member of the Electronic Lien Network, refer to\nJoining ELP\n.\nNote: All banking and financial institutions that record 50 or more auto liens per calendar year are required to electronically transmit lien information to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) through an approved service provider.\nProcess Description\nCurrently, when an application for a new title indicates a lien, DMV provides the lienholder with the titling information on a paper form. This information includes a description of the vehicle, the name and address of the vehicle owner as well as the name and address of the lienholder.\nWith the Electronic Lien Program (ELP), a lien/title message containing essential identifying information is bundled into an electronic envelope and sent to the lienholder\u2019s electronic folder. The lienholder retrieves the messages from the folder, sorts and matches them to their files and then stores the information electronically.\nWhen the lien is satisfied, the lienholder sends an electronic message to a DMV folder, authorizing release of the title to the vehicle owner. DMV retrieves the message, matches it to its files and then prints the title and mails it to the vehicle owner.\nThe two DMV folders are:\nA normal folder for all messages except \"emergency\" messages. This folder is emptied and processed each night, and\nAn \"emergency\" folder for \"distributive printing\" (release of the \"title print held\" condition). This folder is emptied and processed on an hourly basis during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST, or EDST, Monday through Friday (excluding State Holidays).\nYou can find out more about the ELP process by reviewing the\nELP Processing Overview\n.\nResponsibilities\nDMV\nLienholder\nAdditional Information\nJoining ELP\nApplication Form\nContacts\nProcessing Overview\nRequirements and Transaction Descriptions\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
