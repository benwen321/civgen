    "text_content": "Applying\nIn order to join the Electronic Lien Program (ELP), the lienholder must complete a contract with DMV and meet the necessary hardware and software requirements. For DMV contact information and a list of approved vendors, refer to\nELP Contacts\n.\nYou must take the following steps to apply for the program:\nElectronically complete and save the Electronic Lien Program Application (form\nVSA-78\n).\nDownload the Electronic Lien and Title Program Agreement (form\nVSA-150\n).\nThis document must be signed by the president or financial officer of your business, or by someone authorized to enter into agreements on their behalf. Such authorization must be documented on business letterhead with signature of the president or financial officer, as appropriate, and submitted with the Electronic Lien and Title Program Agreement.\nScan the signed and completed Electronic Lien and Title Program Agreement (VSA-150) along with supporting authorization (if applicable).\nEmail the completed ELP Application (form VSA 78), the signed ELP Agreement (form VSA-150), and any supporting authorization to DMV at\neltprogram@dmv.virginia.gov\n.\nA final copy of the Agreement, signed by DMV, will be sent for your records once all documents are received and your application is approved.\nProject Phases\nIn general, the lienholder should ensure that the following phases are considered:\nPurchase necessary software and hardware, or engage the services of a consultant to perform the tasks numbered 1 through 6.\nDevelop programming and test data and conduct internal programming tests.\nObtain contract and lienholder codes from DMV.\nConduct tests of transmission of data to DMV.\nDevelop internal monitoring, tracking and correction systems.\nDevelop a system to track transactions.\nDevelop an internal system and process as needed to ensure data integrity.\nDesignate a person to serve as primary automated system contact for DMV.\nPartnerships: Working with Dealerships and Branches\nSince most titling activity occurs at vehicle dealerships, it may be a good idea to involve your dealerships and branches early on when joining the Electronic Lien Program. DMV's initial contact comes from paperwork submitted by dealers or lienholder's branch office personnel to DMV offices around the state, or from electronic transmissions received through the On-Line Dealer Program.\nFor instance, you may want to have a combination of paper and electronic titles. You may want your loans made through your commercial lines to produce paper titles, while those made through your consumer line are electronic. DMV and the lienholders must rely on the dealership or branch to submit applications that correctly identify the lienholder AND the lienholder's ELP status.\nThis is because DMV establishes title transactions based on the information provided on the \"Application for Certificate of Title and Registration \" (form\nVSA-17A\n). DMV personnel can only use the identifying information that the dealership or lienholder's branch office provides on the application.\nFor these reasons, keeping the dealerships and lienholder's branch offices fully informed of the status of the program, and of changes as they occur, helps to maintain both the volume and the accuracy of ELP transactions.",
