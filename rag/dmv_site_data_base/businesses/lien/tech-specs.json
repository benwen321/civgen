Access to the Advantis network can be accomplished via leased line or dial access.\nADVANTIS Information Exchange Access:\nLienholders who access the Advantis network directly must be able to interface with the IE service. Advantis provides the EXPEDITE family of software products to accomplish interface with IE. EXPEDITE versions are available for the following systems: DOS, OS/2, Windows, AIX, SCO XENIX, CICS, MVS and VM.\nMessage Translation Software\n: The program requires lienholders to format ELP messages using the AAMVAnet AMIE message format. Two programs are available from AAMVAnet to perform the task of encoding and decoding the AMIE format.\nUNI (Unified Network Interface) is the network interface software designed to handle messages between two or more AAMVAnet sites. The program edits inbound and outbound messages, performs message routing and translates messages into the AMIE format. UNI is available for the following systems: CICS/VSAM, OS/2-CICS/IDX, IMS/DL1, Unisys 1100, and Data General. Versions are under development for UNIX\nAMIE/ba (AMIE Batch) is a message translator only. The program currently is available only for the IBM MVS system as well as PC/DOS systems. AAMVAnet has stated that versions of AMIE/ba for other systems could be developed, tested and delivered in three weeks.\nNote: UNI and AMIE/ba are proprietary products of AAMVAnet.\nDMV Constraints\nBefore testing with AAMVAnet, be sure to use\nonly\ntwo (2) Alpha characters as your Origin Code (x7) field. Also ensure that the first two Alpha characters of your lienholder ID number match your Origin Code.\nDMV uses the Batch version of the UNI software and therefore requires the inbound messages to be formatted as follows:\nsend field (filename)\nclass (pctext)\ndelimit (c)\naccount (vamv)\nuserid (vamvelt)\nfor Regular Mailbox\n02/3\n(vamvele)\nfor Emergency Mailbox\n(vamvtst)\nfor Testing Mailbox\nDetailed Specifications and Lienholder Codes: Contact AAMVAnet to obtain a copy of the detailed specifications, and to obtain the two-digit \"GAP\" code.
