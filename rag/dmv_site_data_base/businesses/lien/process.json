When DMV identifies the lienholder as an electronic lien program participant, it adds an electronic lien indicator (Title held: electronic lien). This tells DMV personnel that no paper title was produced.\nWho Sends:\nDMV\nHow It Works:\nDMV extracts the minimum identifying information from DMV\u2019s records and transmits it to the lienholder. The title will not print until the lienholder releases it (lien satisfied) or requests the title to be printed (print only). The lienholder electronically matches the message against its own customer records and notifies DMV if it cannot match a record to the information contained in the record.\nLien Satisfied\nWhen Sent:\nWhen the loan (lien on vehicle) has been paid off.\nWho Sends:\nLienholder\nHow It Works:\nWhen a lien satisfied message is received from the lienholder, DMV will electronically remove the name and address of the lienholder sending the message. DMV will then check for any other liens for that vehicle.\nNo Other Lien:\nDMV will remove the electronic lien indicator and print the title. The title is mailed to the vehicle owner, either at the owner\u2019s address of record or to the address indicated in a distributive mailing message, the next day.\nAdditional Lien on Record:\nDMV will move the name and address of the lienholder with the oldest lien into the primary lienholder field. The electronic lien indicator will be removed and the title will be printed and mailed to the new primary lienholder if that lienholder is not a participant in the Electronic Lien Program.\nPrint Only\nWhen Sent:\nWhenever the lienholder needs the paper title. This can occur in instances of repossession, sale of paper, dealer pay-off, or other change in vehicle or lien ownership.\nWho Sends:\nLienholder\nHow It Works:\nThe lienholder requests a print only transaction by flagging the appropriate record and including the correct code. This message is sent to DMV electronically.\nDMV will remove the electronic lien indicator. The title is printed and mailed to the lienholder the next day.\nDistributive Printing (Release of \"title print held\" condition)\nWhen Sent:\nWhenever the lienholder has determined that a printed title is required within 24 hours. This can occur in instances of repossession, sale of paper, dealer pay-off, or other change in vehicle or lien ownership. The title can be printed either with the lien interest released (satisfied) or with the lien intact, as requested by the lienholder.\nWho Sends:\nLienholder (to the \"Emergency\" folder)\nHow It Works:\nThe lienholder requests that the \"title print held\" condition be removed and indicates whether or not the lien interest is to be released, and to which of DMV\u2019s Customer Service Centers(CSC) the designated representative of the lienholder, an insurance company, another financial institution, or a dealership, or the customer will go to pick up the printed title (the representative or the customer must have appropriate identification). DMV will release the electronic lien indicator and the \"title print held\" condition, which will allow the CSC to print the title. The designated CSC will be notified, by DMV prior to the close of the business day, of the name of the entity from which a representative will come to pick up the paper title. The designated CSC will print the title for the representative upon presentation of proper identification and a letter from that entity identifying the representative as authorized to receive the printed title. These messages are to be sent to DMV\u2019s \"Emergency\" folder, ONLY.\nDistributive Mailing\nWhen Sent:\nWhenever the lienholder has determined that the title must be mailed to the owner in care of either a dealership, insurance company, or another financial institution. This can occur in instances of dealer pay-off, insurance company pay-off, refinancing by another financial institution, or sale of paper to another financial institution. This message includes a release of lien interest (lien satisfaction).\nWho Sends:\nLienholder\nHow It Works:\nThe lienholder requests a release of lien interest, including a distributive mailing request, indicating the name and address to which the title is to be mailed. DMV will remove the electronic lien indicator, satisfy the lien, print the title, and mail it to the customer, in care of the specified name and address. These titles will be mailed within one business day.\nError Message\nWhen Sent:\nWhenever a message is transmitted that cannot be identified or matched to a record, or when DMV transmitted information incorrectly.\nWho Sends:\nDMV and lienholders\nHow It Works:\nEither DMV or the lienholder should send an error message if it discovers:\nData transmitted by mistake that should not have been sent;\nData that should have been sent, but contained errors;\nProblems with its programs transmitting the data.\nMost errors transmitted are resolved electronically. However, the DMV and the lienholder are responsible for researching and correcting such problems.\nLien Satisfied and Print Title Verifications\nWhen Sent:\nWhenever a lienholder has notified DMV that a lien has been satisfied or requests a title to be printed.\nWho Sends:\nDMV\nHow It Works:\nOnce the title has been printed, DMV will generate a verification message which contains information identifying the vehicle. This message will be sent back to the requesting lienholder as confirmation that the title was printed. The vehicle record will be updated to indicate that the title has been released.\nPrint Only Transaction\nWhen Sent:\nLienholders should use this transaction when they need the title document in order to:\nAdd an owner to the title\nChange the lienholder\nHandle a routine, non-emergency dealer payoff or\nPurchase\nRepossess a vehicle\nTransfer ownership of the vehicle\nWho Sends:\nLienholder\nHow It Works:\nThe lienholder requests the title to be printed, without releasing their interest in the lien. DMV changes the electronic lien indicator, removes the \"title print held\" condition and prints the title overnight, mailing it to the lienholder the next day.",
