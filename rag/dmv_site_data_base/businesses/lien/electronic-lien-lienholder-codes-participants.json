Titles not picked up within one week will be printed and mailed to the owner of record, if the lien interest has been released, or mailed to the lienholder, if the lien has not been satisfied. Titles not picked up within 48 hours will be logged in order to control abuse of the emergency message system.\nDMV will read the emergency folder on an hourly basis during the hours of 7:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. EST, or EDST, Monday through Friday (excluding State Holidays).\nCorrection of Errors\nThe lienholder will notify DMV Headquarters of errors in transmission and/or data by the next working day after the error is discovered. Notification can be through the nightly production process or by telephone.\nDuring the evening, call the DMV Computer Operations Room at (804) 367-6743 (data transmission errors).\nDuring the day, call the DMV Electronic Lienholder Work Center at (804) 367-2495 or 367-2841.",
