    "text_content": "The\nOnline Dealer\nautomated interface system provides an electronic link between DMV and Virginia motor vehicle dealers. This interface provides a means for Virginia dealerships to issue registration cards, metal license plates and decals at the point of sale and electronically update DMV's vehicle files. Titles are printed at DMV and mailed after DMV receives the transaction paperwork.\nThe interface is facilitated by software and hardware provided by approved\nthird party vendors\nunder contract with the dealer.\nAll independent dealers that sell 100 or more vehicles annually are required to join the Online Dealer program and are considered Online Dealers. Independent dealers selling fewer than 100 vehicles annually are encouraged to take advantage of this convenient, cost-saving program. These requirements apply to all dealer types licensed by the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle, trailer and RV).\nNote:\nThe 100 vehicle sales threshold for independent dealers is a total of all vehicles sold at a location.\nFor more information of interest to dealers, refer to\nDealer Services\n.\nBenefits\nThe Online Dealer program allows the dealer to avoid the inconvenience of having to deliver documents to DMV. Instead, DMV provides a courier service or postage for the dealer to send these documents to DMV headquarters for review and imaging. All taxes and fees are transferred electronically, eliminating the need to write checks for payment of taxes and fees.\nThe Online Dealer program enables the customer to obtain their plates, decals and registration card at the dealership instead of having to go to a DMV customer service center. In addition, any special plate ordered by the customer is mailed directly to the customer from DMV's manufacturing facility, along with the associated decals. This added convenience to the customer reflects favorably on the participating dealer.\nProcess\nThe process begins with the dealer selling the vehicle to the customer.\nUsing the vendor's software and hardware, the dealer submits the electronic application for title and registration, including lienholder information, if appropriate.\nThe dealer removes the license plates and decals from the inventory on site at the dealership, as managed and indicated by the vendor's system, and prints a permanent registration card.\nDMV returns the appropriate information, including the title and log numbers, through the vendor's host system back to the dealer.\nThe dealer writes the title and log numbers and the date of the transaction on the face of the MCO or MSO or title. The title and a paper title application form must be submitted to DMV.\nThe vendor withdraws the funds from the dealer's account (set up for this purpose) to cover the fees and taxes due to DMV, forwards those funds to DMV's account via an Electronic Funds Transfer, and sends DMV a deposit certificate.\nThe dealer sends daily reports and all documentation for submitted transactions to DMV via DMV's courier service. The courier service is provided at no cost to the dealer.\nDMV prints the titles overnight and mails them directly to either the customer or the lienholder, whichever is appropriate.\nResponsibilities\nVendor:\nTrains dealer personnel\nActs as the liaison between the dealer and DMV\nPerforms the daily deposit of funds into DMV\u2019s account\nHandles the daily reconciliation and summary reports\nManages the inventory of license plates and decals\nEnsures that the dealer complies with DMV\u2019s procedures\nDealer:\nSubmits the electronic application transaction for titles and registrations\nPrints registration cards\nResponsible for the on-site DMV inventory (e.g., plates and decals) and storing it in a secure location.\nForwards daily reports and ownership documents directly to DMV\nProcesses transactions in the vendor's system within 30 days of the sale.\nDealers licensed by the MVDB are required to pass the costs that the vendor charges for the transaction to the customer.\nContacts\nFor contact information for DMV and authorized vendors, please refer to\nOnline Dealer/Fleet Contacts\n.",
