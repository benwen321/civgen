    "text_content": "Virginia is required to collect a 4.15% Sales and Use Tax (SUT) at the time of titling whenever a vehicle is sold, and/or the ownership of the vehicle changes.\nThe amount due is based on the vehicle's gross sales price, or $75, whichever is greater.\nWhat is the Gross Sales Price?\nThe gross sales price of a vehicle is the cost of the vehicle\nafter\nany rebates or incentives are applied. It includes the dealer processing fee, but does not include any other price reductions, such as credit for trade-ins, unpaid liens or other unpaid credits.\nExemptions from the SUT Tax\nFor a complete list of exemptions, visit the\nCode of Virginia\u2019s Exemptions\n. Certain exemptions\u00a0require proof of your exemption status and a completed\nPurchaser's Statement of Tax Exemption\nto indicate the reason for exemption.\nThe Most Common SUT Exemption\nIf you are titling your vehicle in Virginia for the first time and you hold a valid title or registration in your name\nby another state or a branch of the United States Armed Forces,\nyou will not have to pay the SUT. However, if you purchased the vehicle within the last 12 months, you must provide proof that the SUT was paid elsewhere in order to be exempt in Virginia.\nCalculating the SUT Tax\nFor transactions between private individuals\nThe sales price entered by the seller on the title certificate is a bill of sale.\nHowever, you may be required to submit another form of a bill of sale under the following circumstances:\nIf the vehicle is more than 5 years old\n, and the seller has not entered the sales price or an incorrect sales price was entered on the title, the Vehicle Price Certification (\nSUT 1\n) or a handwritten bill of sale may be submitted. The handwritten bill of sale must be signed by the seller\nand\nthe buyer and include the purchase price, year, make, model, vehicle identification number and date of sale.\nIf the vehicle is less than 5 years old\n(based on the model year), you must provide an Affidavit for Procurement of Title (\nSUT-1A\n) to DMV at the time of titling. The SUT-1A is required when the sales price is not within a $1,500 variance of the current trade-in value as listed in the\nNADA Official Used Car Guide\n.\nFor purchases from a dealer or manufacturer\nThey calculate the SUT for you.",
