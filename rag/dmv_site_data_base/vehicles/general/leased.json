Anything less than 12 months is considered \"renting.\"\nIf you're considering leasing a vehicle in Virginia, here's a helpful overview.\nLeasing Terminology\nLessee\nThe person or entity offering compensation in exchange for the use of a vehicle for 12 months or more.\nLessor (owner)\nThe person or entity offering the use of a vehicle for 12 months or more in exchange for compensation. In Virginia, lessors do not need to be licensed, and may be known as a \"leasing company.\" A Virginia-licensed vehicle dealer may be considered the vehicle lessor for purposes of the\nMotor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax\n(SUT) exemption.\nPower of Attorney (POA)\nA legal document used to name another person or entity to handle vehicle-related paperwork (e.g., titling, registration, etc.) for a leased vehicle.\nResidual Value\nThe value of a leased vehicle at the end of the term of the lease. The residual value is normally specified in the lease contract.\nSelling Dealer\nA Virginia-licensed vehicle dealer who sold the vehicle to the lessor and arranged for the lease between the lessee and the lessor.\nTitling Your Leased Vehicle\nUnless you buy the vehicle at the end of your leasing agreement,\nyou do not need to title your leased vehicle.\nThe leased vehicle will be titled in the name of the lessor, who is responsible for paying all associated fees at the time of titling, such as the $15 title fee and the SUT.\nRegistering a Leased Vehicle\nRegistration responsibility is generally covered in the lease agreement. While the vehicle can be registered in the lessor's or lessee's name, it is most often the lessee's responsibility.\nIf the lessor allows DMV to include the lessee name in the title record, the lessee may handle all vehicle registration transactions, including transferring plates to and from the leased vehicle, ordering\nspecial or personalized plates\nand renewing the vehicle registration.\nIf the lessee's name is not on the title record, they may still handle vehicle registration transactions by using a power of attorney (POA) from the lessor.\nIf the lessee paid the registration fees, they will receive any registration renewal reminders and registration refunds for the leased vehicle without the need to provide a POA. Otherwise, this information is mailed to the lessor.\nBuying Out Your Vehicle Lease\nWhen a lease ends, the lessee can either return the leased vehicle, or buy it from the lessor.\nIf you return the vehicle\n, the lessor is responsible for any vehicle-related actions moving forward.\nIf you buy the vehicle\n, you must re-title the vehicle in your name and pay\nMotor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax\n(SUT), which is based on the residual value paid by the lessee to the lessor.\nSUT Exemption\nIf you already paid the SUT when you leased the vehicle, you may be exempt from paying it again, if:\nYou present proof you paid the SUT in Virginia\nThe title includes your name on the lease and not a commercial entity\nYou purchased the vehicle directly from the lessor, or from the selling dealer if one existed\nPersonal Property Tax Relief\nVehicles leased to a person (instead of a business) and primarily used for non-business purposes may qualify for Personal Property Tax Relief. See\nCode of Virginia\nfor what qualifies as non-business purposes.\nIf you have not received tax relief on a leased vehicle that you believe qualifies, contact your lessor and ask them to double-check they've reported your vehicle to DMV.\nIf your lessor has reported your vehicle and you have not received tax relief, contact your local Commissioner of the Revenue or Director of Finance.\nLessors are required to report potentially qualifying leased vehicles to DMV. Commissioners of the Revenue use this information to identify vehicles qualifying for tax relief.\nSee\nPersonal Property Tax Relief\nfor more information.",
