Get in the habit of checking for recalls and getting your car repaired.\nMillions of vehicles are recalled in the United States every year due to important safety issues. Recalls should be addressed quickly and should never be ignored.\nDMV urges you to get in the habit of checking for recalls. Consider it part of the routine maintenance of your vehicle.\nIf your vehicle is recalled, the manufacturer will send a letter to the address that you have listed on your DMV vehicle registration. However, people often overlook recall notices or move without updating their address. It is best to be proactive to make sure your vehicle is safe to drive.\nCheck for Recalls\nTo check for outstanding recalls on your vehicle, get your vehicle identification number (VIN) and visit NHTSA\u2019s recall lookup site -\nwww.nhtsa.gov/recalls\n. You can also call NHTSA\u2019s Safety Hotline at 1(888) 327-4236.\nVehicle owners can sign up for NHTSA recall alerts to learn about new recalls prior to manufacturers mailing recall notices to affected owners. Receive recall alerts on\nApple and Android devices\n, or by\nemail\n.\nGet Your Vehicle Fixed\nContact a dealership in your area to schedule necessary repairs. Vehicle manufacturers are required by law to make recall repairs at no cost to the customer.\nFind Out More\nAdditional information on the recall process is available at\nVehicle Recall Frequently Asked Questions\n.",
