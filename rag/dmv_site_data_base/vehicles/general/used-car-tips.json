    "text_content": "In Virginia, nearly one out of every three car sales is between two individuals, rather than between a buyer and a licensed vehicle dealer. DMV has some suggestions for those who are buying a car from anyone other than a licensed dealer.\nDo the Research\nBefore you start shopping, know how much you are willing to pay and stick to your budget.\nResearch the value of the vehicle you may purchase. Several websites offer vehicle value estimates if you type in the year, make, model and mileage including the Kelley Blue Book website at\nwww.kbb.com\nand the National Automobile Dealers Association\nUsed Car Guide\n.\nObtain information on the vehicle you plan to purchase through DMV's\nProspective Purchaser Inquiry (PPI)\n, through the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (\nNMVTIS\n), or purchase a vehicle history report from a company such as CARFAX or AutoCheck.\nOnline Shopping Tips\nWebsites that require the seller to pay a fee to post their vehicle advertisement are recommended rather than free websites that are more likely to attract scams.\nTo check a seller's reputation, look for other customer reviews on the website about the vehicle's seller.\nWebsites such as Craigslist and eBay are meant to connect local buyers and sellers; for example, Craigslist advises that offers to ship vehicles are fraudulent.\nAsk for larger, better pictures of the vehicle's exterior and interior from different angles to decide if it is worth seeing in person.\nDo not give the seller your street address and arrange a test drive in a public place.\nInspect the Vehicle\nAsk the seller for the vehicle's maintenance record and verify the car was properly maintained.\nGet the vehicle inspected by a licensed mechanic.\nMake sure the vehicle has a spare tire, jack and lug wrench. If the vehicle has locking hubcaps, make sure the seller has the key for removing them.\nCheck every light, all gauges, windshield wipers and washers, power windows, seats and locks, audio systems, and every other electronic component on the vehicle for proper operation.\nAsk the seller to provide the title for the vehicle. Not providing the title could indicate that the vehicle has liens against it.\nVerify that the person who signs the Bill of Sale is the actual owner of the car by comparing the owner's name on the title to the seller's identification.\nAfter a price for the vehicle is agreed upon, create a written contract including sale price, car condition and method of payment. Get the contract notarized while both parties sign it.\nNever pay for a vehicle with cash.\nChecking for Water Damage\nLook for signs of spray paint on moldings; also check the edges of the doors, hood and trunk to be sure they are all the same color. Fresh paint may cover rust that will continue to progress.\nInspect for rusting on the inside of the car and under interior carpeting.\nVisually inspect all interior upholstery and door panels for any evidence of fading, discoloration or stains.\nCheck for any dampness in the carpet and upholstery or moisture inside interior lights and dashboard gauges.\nCheck for new or mismatched interior components and loose or poor-fitting carpet, upholstery and panels.\nCheck for any musty, sour, or mildew-like odors from the carpet and upholstery and the trunk area.\nCheck for rust on screws in the console or other areas where water would normally not reach unless submerged.\nComplete a detailed inspection of the electrical wiring system looking for rusted components, water residue or suspicious corrosion. Check wiring under the dash to make sure it is flexible and bends without cracking, rather than brittle and hard.\nCheck for silt, gravel and mud in the trunk, in the glove box and ash trays, and around the dashboard.\nAfter the Purchase\nAfter purchasing your vehicle, as required by Virginia law, you must:\nPurchase liability insurance or pay the $500 uninsured motor vehicle fee.\nObtain a vehicle safety inspection sticker.\nTitle, register and purchase license plates for your vehicle from DMV; the vehicle's current plates remain with the seller.\nDisclaimer\nThe Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) does not endorse or recommend any commercial products, processes or services.
