    "text_content": "Leaving Pets Unattended in Vehicles During Hot Weather\nIn nice weather you may be tempted to take your pet with you in the car while you travel or do errands. However during warm weather, the inside of your car can reach 120 degrees in a matter of minutes, even if you're parked in the shade. This can mean real trouble for companion animals left in the car.\nDogs and cats cannot perspire and can only dispel heat by panting and through the pads of their feet. Pets left in hot cars even briefly can suffer from heat exhaustion, heat stroke, brain damage, and can even die. Even if you'll be gone \"just a minute,\" your pet will not be safe while you're gone. Even being in an air-conditioned car with the motor off is not healthy for your pet.\nTo avoid any chance that your pet will succumb to the heat of a car during warm summer months, be sure to leave your pet at home while you're on the road.\nRestraining Your Pet While Driving\nPets, like children, should be safely restrained while traveling. All it takes is a sudden stop or turn to seriously injure your pet, not to mention what could happen if you got in an accident.\nUnrestrained pets are also the cause of many accidents, as they can distract or even interfere with the driver's ability to control the vehicle. Today's pet restraints and car seats quickly and easily attach to a vehicle's seat belt, and provide plenty of freedom for the pet to sit up or lie down. Wire cages or plastic crates are also excellent choices to protect pets while traveling, as they shield pets from falling objects.",
