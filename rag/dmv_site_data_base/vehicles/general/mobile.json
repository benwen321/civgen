The DHCD fee is not collected on manufactured homes sold by an individual, out-of-state dealer or in a dealer-to-dealer sale.\nTransferring a Manufactured Home to Real Estate\nTo attach a manufactured home to real estate, the Virginia title must be cancelled. To accomplish this cancellation, you must provide the following:\nCompleted Affidavit for Manufactured Home Conversion to Real Property application (\nVSA 35\n)\nVirginia title OR\nif unable to provide a Virginia title-- a deed, court order or decree, or other legal document or record establishing that the manufactured home was transferred by the owner listed on the title in DMV\u2019s records to the current manufactured homeowner\nor if NOT a direct transfer-- records to establish a chain of successive ownership of the manufactured home\nLien release or documentation proving that an existing lien on the vehicle record has been released\nNOTE: You will also need to retain a photocopy of the title or documents being surrendered for your records.\nOnce the Virginia title is cancelled, DMV reports the title cancellation to the Commissioner of the Revenue (COR) in the appropriate locality.
