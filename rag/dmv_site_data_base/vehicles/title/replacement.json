You must also submit the certified or notarized death certificate and one of the following:\nA copy of the will AND a completed \"Authority to Transfer Virginia Title Certification\" (\nVSA 24\n)\nA court-issued document OR copy of the will appointing the executor or administrator\nA completed\nVSA 24\nas proof of legal heir, if there is no will and no executor or administrator has been appointed.\nAn affidavit indicating that the deceased's estate falls under the small estate laws (currently, the value of the estate must be less than $50,000).\nIf you are a joint owner with the right of survivorship and your co-owner is deceased, you may apply for a\nsubstitute title\n, to remove the deceased owner's name, without first applying for replacement title.\nPay the\nreplacement title fee\n.\nReceiving the Replacement Title\nIf your vehicle is free of liens, you will receive a replacement title for your vehicle. If your vehicle originally had a lien on it, you must show that the lien has been satisfied. If the lien has not been satisfied, the replacement title will be sent to the lienholder of record. Once a replacement title is issued, all prior titles are invalid.",
