    "text_content": "How To Title a Vehicle\nA title (also called a title certificate) establishes the legal owner of a vehicle and has important information on it, such as the vehicle identification number (VIN), date of manufacture, and make and model.\nA title proves you own the vehicle. Registration proves the vehicle is authorized to be driven.\nIf you want to title and register your vehicle at the same time, see\nRegister Your Vehicle\nfor a list of what to submit. There is a separate registration fee.\nIf you\u2019re unsure how to fill out the Virginia title or\nApplication for Title and Registration\n, find helpful tips in our\nOnline Title Guide\n.\nStep 2: Pay the following fees\n$15 titling fee\nSales and Use Tax\nNote: If you are exempt from this tax, bring proof of your exemption status or complete the Purchaser's Statement of Tax Exemption.\nStep 3: Record Odometer Reading\nWhen a vehicle is sold or transferred, the seller must record the odometer reading (mileage) in the \u201cassignment\u201d section of the title, and the buyer must record the odometer reading on the Application for Title and Registration.\nIf an out-of-state title does not have an \u201cassignment\u201d section\n, the seller may record the mileage on an\nOdometer Disclosure Statement\n. Please present this to DMV when titling.\nIf an out-of-state title does not have an \u201cassignment\u201d section and the odometer reading is not actual (current)\n, the seller must inform the buyer that it is incorrect by checking the appropriate box on the Odometer Disclosure Statement (\"exceeds actual limits\" or \"odometer reading is not the actual mileage\" or \"exceeds actual limits\").\nIf an out-of-state title shows the vehicle\nwas exempt from odometer disclosure\n, then no odometer disclosure is required for a Virginia title. Simply present the out-of-state title showing the exemption.\nSelecting Electronic or Paper Title\nOn the Application for Certificate of Title and Registration form, you can choose to receive a paper title, or have DMV keep an electronic record of the title to ensure its safety.\nIf you select the electronic option, when you need a paper title in the future, you may visit any customer service center and request one. You\u2019ll be required to show proof you are the registered owner.\nIf no\nlien\never existed on the vehicle record and no paper title was previously issued, a one-time paper title will be issued at no fee.\nIf a lien existed or a paper title was previously printed, the $15\nsubstitute title fee\nwill be charged.\nNote: If the lien is an electronic lien and the lien has been released, a one-time paper title will be issued at no fee, provided it has not been printed already.\nIf you currently have an electronic title\nin good standing with no lien, you may request a paper title\nonline\n, at a\ncustomer service center\nor by mail. If by mail, send a written request and payment (if applicable) to:\nVirginia DMV\nAttn: Titles and Registration Work Center\nP.O. Box 27412\nRichmond, VA 23269\nYour written request should include the VIN number or title number. If the title has never been printed, there is no fee. If it has been previously printed, the fee is $15.\n\nIn-state vehicles or trailers\nProof of purchase price, such as a buyer's order, bill of sale or the seller's declared sale price on the title.\nOut-of-state vehicles or trailers\nIf purchased within the last 12 months, one of the following:\nOut-of-state trailers with no title\nIf your previous state does not issue titles for your specific type of trailer, please present:\nImported vehicles\nSeeTitling an Imported Vehicle in Virginiafor vehicles brought into the U.S. from a foreign country.",
