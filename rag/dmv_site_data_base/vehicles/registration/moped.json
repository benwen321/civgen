Please submit the following:\nOwnership documents (title or manufacturer\u2019s certificate of origin) that came with the vehicle purchase.\nTitle fee and annual registration fee. See\nFee Chart\n.\nCompleted\nMoped Certification\n.\nNote: Customers without an ownership document can submit documentation such as a Bill of Sale with a completed\nMoped and All-Terrain Vehicle Affidavit in Lieu of Title Certificate\n.\nYou\ndo not need\nElectric vehicle fee\nInsurance\nOdometer reading\nSafety inspection\nSee\nMopeds in Virginia\nfor more information on titling and registration.\nSchedule an Appointment\nFind Your Local DMV\nMoped Taxes\nMopeds are subject to the\nSales and Use Tax\n(SUT) and exempt from the retail sales and use tax. The SUT is imposed on the vehicle\u2019s sales price at a rate of:\nSeven percent in the Historic Triangle (City of Williamsburg, James City County and York County)\nSix percent in Hampton Roads, Northern Virginia and Central Virginia\n5.3 percent everywhere else in the Commonwealth of Virginia\nThe minimum SUT of $75 does not apply to mopeds.

Avoid sandals, shorts and short sleeves. Do not carry more people at one time than the moped is designed to carry.\nBe observant.\nKeep an eye on your surroundings. Angle both mirrors to maximize visibility. It is against the law for any person to operate a moped while using earphones.\nRide defensively.\nDo not be aggressive; mopeds are smaller than most other vehicles sharing the road. Night riding is not recommended, but if you must ride at night, wear bright clothing, reflective strips on your jacket and your helmet, and keep your headlight in good working order.\nTake a training course.\nMany driver training schools in Virginia offer courses specific to mopeds. Contact a\nVirginia Rider Training Program\nlocation to see if it offers moped training courses.",
