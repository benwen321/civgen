    "text_content": "The General Assembly passed legislation regarding the initial vehicle registration of vehicles by those with delinquent taxes or fees, including local vehicle license fees, delinquent tangible personal property tax or parking citations. People with delinquent taxes or fees may receive a \u201cstop.\u201d A stop restricts access to the driver and vehicle records, prohibiting transactions until the issue has been resolved.\nDMV issued a limited initial registration for a period of\nup to 90 days\nfor a vehicle purchased after a stop is placed by a locality for delinquent taxes or fees. This allows customers to purchase a vehicle but grants time to satisfy delinquent taxes or fees. Once the taxes or fees are satisfied, DMV may issue a full one, two, or three year registration. This legislation does not change how DMV handles registration renewal. Customers with stops for delinquent taxes or fees are still not allowed to renew or transfer a vehicle registration.\n\nWho is eligible for the up to 90-day initial registration?\nA customer who purchases and attempts to register a vehicle after a stop is placed for delinquent taxes or fees will only receive a registration for a period of up to 90 days.\nHow will I know if I have a customer stop for delinquent taxes or fees?\nDMV sends a letter at least 30 days before the registration expiration date for a vehicle you own. This letter replaces the normal renewal invitation from DMV. It informs you that there are conditions on your record that prevent DMV from renewing the registration or issuing a registration for any unregistered vehicle(s) you currently own or lease.\nWhat if I have multiple stops on my record for different discrepancies or conditions?\nCustomers with multiples stops may not be eligible for the up to 90-day limited registration. Some customer stops have shorter limited registration periods. In the case of customers with multiple stops with different limited registration periods, the shortest limited registration period will apply.\nCan DMV tell me how much I owe for delinquent taxes or fees?\nDMV does not know how much you owe and cannot answer questions about taxes or fees you are required to pay. You must contact the local city, county or town.\nCan DMV remove the stop once I pay the delinquent taxes or fees?\nOnce you contact the locality and satisfy all delinquent taxes or fees, the locality will remove the stop within 24 hours of receipt of payment.",
