    "text_content": "A trailer can be defined as a vehicle without motor power designed for carrying property or passengers entirely on its own structure and that is drawn by a motor vehicle, including tow dollies and converter gear (\u00a7\n46.2-100\n).\nTrailers can be registered annually, bi-annually or permanently. The\ntrailer registration fee\nis based on the gross weight of the trailer and the registration period selected. Insurance coverage for trailers depends on the\ninsurance coverage\nof the vehicle pulling the trailer.\nPermanent License Plates for Trailers\nPermanent license plates are available for all private, for-hire and rental trailers, regardless of their weight, for a one-time fee.\nA registration card will be issued for a trailer with permanent plates.\nThe license plate will not have a month and year decal unless it is on a rental trailer, nor will it have a month or year expiration. Plates are embossed with the word \"Permanent\".\nFor trailers that have a gross weight of 4,000 pounds or less, you may choose a full size or small (motorcycle size) permanent license plate.\nPermanent trailer plates for rental trailers will display an orange decal with a white \"R\" to designate the trailer as a rental.\nThere is no additional registration fee for as long as you own the trailer. If ownership changes new plates will have to be purchased.\nTo order permanent plates, complete an \"Application for Registration\" (\nVSA-14\n) and check \"permanent\" for registration type.\nPersonalized messages are available for an additional one-time fee.\nPermanent plates are neither transferable nor refundable.\nIf your permanent plate is lost, mutilated or illegible it can be replaced for a fee.
