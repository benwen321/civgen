    "text_content": "A state-owned vehicle is a vehicle owned by a government agency and used for official state business. Some processes and requirements are different for state-owned vehicles than for personal vehicles.\nTitling and Registering a State-Owned Vehicle\nUnlike personal vehicles, state registrations do not expire and state-owned vehicles must have license plates with a \"state designation.\"\nBecause of these distinctions, when completing the\nApplication for Certificate of Title and Registration\nfor a state-owned vehicle, you must\nselect \"YES\" where it asks \"Is vehicle state or locality owned?\"\nand include the correct state agency code.\nIf the code is incorrect, the vehicle may be excluded from DMV's listing of state-owned vehicles.\nSee\ntitling\nand\nregistering\na vehicle for more information.\nEZFleet and EZReg\nThe EZFleet system allows companies with fleets of 75 or more vehicles to title and register vehicles in Virginia without having to visit a DMV customer service center. In addition to titling and registration,\nEZFleet\nallows you to renew registrations and maintain your fleet vehicle records without ever leaving your office.\nCompanies with fleets between 25 and 74 vehicles are eligible to participate in\nEZReg\n.\nDisposing of a State-Owned Vehicle\nState agencies are prohibited from selling state-owned vehicles. When a state agency wants to dispose of a vehicle, they are required to notify the Virginia Department of General Services (DGS) Office of Surplus Property Management (OSPM). OSPM will coordinate the disposal of the state asset.\nSee\nDGS Rules & Regulations\nfor instructions.\nDGS sells vehicles and other property through auction. After the vehicle is sold, DGS notifies the state agency. In addition, DGS notifies DMV of the change in ownership and requests removal of the vehicle's state registration from DMV's database.\nIf a state agency disposes of a vehicle without contacting DGS, the agency is responsible for notifying DMV. A surplus vehicle remains in the agency's inventory until DMV receives notification it has been sold.\nMonitoring Driver Status\nAnyone operating a state-owned vehicle must have a valid driver's license. For temporary assignments or trip pool use, an employee must show the transportation officer a driver's license before using the vehicle.\nAll state agencies with long-term vehicle assignments should participate in DMV's\nDriver Alert\nprogram offered free to public organizations. Driver Alert notifies employers if their state drivers are exhibiting unsafe driving habits.\nDriver Alert allows the state agency to request:\nImmediate alert of moving violation convictions\nImmediate alert if drivers accumulate seven adverse points within a calendar year\nImmediate alert of suspensions, revocations, disqualifications, reckless driving or driving while intoxicated convictions\nMonth and day you wish to receive annual risk management driver records, which are required for companies who employ drivers with commercial driver's licenses",
