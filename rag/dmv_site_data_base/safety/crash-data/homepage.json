    "text_content": "Background\nThe\nTraffic Records Management, Reporting and Analysis Division\nof the Virginia Highway Safety Office (VAHSO) manages the states' highway safety traffic records information system that houses millions of traffic crash records. Data that is collected, stored and analyzed by this Division is used for problem identification and resolution by local, state and federal entities across the Commonwealth.\nThis data is housed in the Traffic Records Electronic Data System (\nTREDS\n). TREDS, the first of its kind in Virginia, is a state-of-the-art traffic crash data system that automates and centralizes crash information from across the state. Its many benefits include the electronic submission of police crash reports, the electronic capture of GPS coordinates for reporting of specific crash locations and the elimination of separate crash data repositories in multiple formats.\nThe Traffic Records Management, Reporting and Analysis Division engages in strategic planning to ensure the effective use of its existing Virginia traffic records information system to support and highlight the Commonwealth's safety programs and grant funding initiatives.\nCreate an Interactive Report/Map Crash Data\nYou have three options:\nCreate an\nInteractive Crash Data Report\nExplore the\nHigh Crash Location Map\nExplore the\nCrash Location Map by Jurisdiction\nCrash Facts\nVirginia Traffic Crash Facts\nLegislative District Crash Data Summaries\nSenate Districts\nHouse Districts\nOther Highway Safety Related Data\nAlcohol Trends\nVirginia Motor Vehicle Statistics\nSeat Belt Use Rates\nMotorcycle Endorsements\nMotorcycle Registrations",
