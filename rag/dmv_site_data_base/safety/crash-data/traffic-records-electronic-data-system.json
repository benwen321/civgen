    "text_content": "The main goal of the Traffic Records Electronic Data System (TREDS) is to be Virginia's \"one-stop-shop\" to provide accurate, timely and detailed highway safety information for analysis and reporting. TREDS data is used to support Virginia's efforts to reduce crashes, injuries, fatalities and associated costs. Through TREDS, Virginia now has one of the most effective and innovative information technology tools in the nation to identify and address its highway safety concerns.\nThis state-of-the-art, automated data system centralizes all of Virginia's crash data and related information. It allows for the electronic submission of police crash reports, electronic mapping for locating the crash while completing the crash report, electronic crash diagramming, and integration with other data systems for enhanced data mining, analysis and reporting at various levels.\nImportance of Traffic Crash Data\nThe comprehensive data housed in TREDS is the foundation of highway safety in Virginia. The information serves as a performance measurement tool that reflects Virginia's efforts to improve highway safety. TREDS traffic crash information can be used to:\nConduct problem identification and develop resolutions for safety programs\nCreate and implement effective, integrated safety programs and initiatives\nConduct education and awareness initiatives\nMake executive management decisions\nAward and target federal highway safety funding\nMake key legislative decisions that impact citizen safety on our roadways\nTarget local and state law enforcement efforts\nMake engineering and construction improvements to our roadways\nWork with partnering organizations to develop coordinated, innovative approaches to improve highway safety\nTREDS is paving the way for Virginia's effort to develop and implement effective safety programs that will make Virginia's roadways among the safest in the country.",
