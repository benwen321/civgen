    "text_content": "Objective: To accurately identify specific locations/sections of streets and highways that have high or potentially high crash incidence, as a basis for establishing priorities for improvement, selective enforcement, or other operational practices that will eliminate or reduce the hazards at the location/section identified.\nExamples of Fundable Projects\nDevelop/improve computerized crash locator and surveillance systems.\nIdentify, investigate, and evaluate intersections or sections of highways with high crash rates and develop a program to reduce hazards.\nCreate multidisciplinary teams to\nInvestigate crashes in order to determine those designs and operating features associated with high crash frequencies or severities; and,\nMake recommendations for implementation based on findings from crash investigations.\nInnovative programs designed to address identified problems in the areas of identification and surveillance of crash locations, highway design, and construction and maintenance.\nFixed Objects and Roadside Hazards\nStudy single vehicle/fixed object crashes and develop corrective measures.\nDevelop guidelines for urban streets relating to fixed object placement and crash potential.\nIdentify high and potentially high fixed object crash locations and recommend countermeasures.\nConduct roadside hazard inspection to develop severity index for establishment of priorities for improvement.\nProvide training in highway safety-related design.\nConduct studies of selected highway corridors.\nTraining of traffic engineers/engineering technicians at short courses/seminars in safety-related curricula.\nStudies of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts at selected intersections with recommendations for increased control.\nAutomation of record keeping and data retrieval procedures for inventory traffic control devices.\nSource: The Guidelines for the Submission of Highway Safety Grant Applications.",
