    "text_content": "About Product Tracking\nDMV's product tracking lets you see when you may receive your new or renewed Virginia driver's license or ID card, license plates or disabled parking placard. Similar to ecommerce or shipping sites that show when orders are produced and mailed, you can follow the production timeline online.\nCustomers can track the delivery status of the following DMV products:\nDriver's License or ID Card\nDisabled Parking Placard\nLicense Plate\nTo see the delivery status of your driver's license/ID card or disabled parking placard, you must log into or create a myDMV account with your secure\nPIN\n. It is not necessary to log in to see the status of a license plate.\nThese transactions allow you to see either that the product is being produced, or the date that the product was mailed. In the event the product is returned as undeliverable by USPS to DMV, or another error occurs during production, we ask that you\ncontact DMV\n.",
