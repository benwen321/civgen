    "text_content": "DMV is committed to protecting your identity and the integrity of the documents we issue.\nYou can minimize your risk of identity theft by understanding how DMV protects your information and what to do if you suspect fraudulent activity.\nDetecting Driver's License and ID Fraud\nIndividuals who are not eligible for a license or ID card may resort to submitting counterfeit or fraudulent documents in order to obtain a valid credential. Often, this includes the use of another person's identity.\nWe are trained to recognize and detect counterfeit identity documents used to attempt to fraudulently obtain a driver's license or ID.\nIf you have reason to believe someone may be using a driver's license or ID with your name and information, contact your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Then\ncontact DMV\nto report this information. You may also send an email to:\nzerofraud@dmv.virginia.gov\n.\nIf the theft of your identity involves your driver's license or ID card, DMV will help in any way we can.\nContact DMV to Report Identity Theft\nProcessing Identity Theft Passports\nAn Identity Theft Passport proves to law enforcement that you\u2019ve been a victim of identity theft.\nIf you believe you\u2019re a victim of identity theft, visit any DMV\ncustomer service center\nto apply. We\u2019ll give you a receipt verifying your application was submitted, and forward the application to the Office of the Attorney General, which runs the Identity Theft Passport program.\nA representative from the Office of the Attorney General will contact you to process the application and provide assistance.\nMake an Appointment to Visit DMV\nIssuing Customer Numbers\nTo protect your identity, DMV no longer issues driver's licenses and ID cards that display Social Security numbers (SSN). If your SSN is displayed on your license or ID, you can get a replacement credential with a customer number instead of your SSN.\nGenerally, a DMV customer number alone is useless to an identity thief.\nReplace Your License Online\nYou can also apply for a replacement at any DMV customer service center. You must present a current valid Virginia driver's license and one other form of identification.\nSafeguarding Customer Information\nYour customer information is safe with us. All DMV records are privileged and are not available to the general public. We may only release driver, vehicle and personal information from our records under certain conditions outlined in our\nrelease of information\npolicies.\nGranting Driving Record Requests\nJust as you would review your credit report for fraudulent activity, we encourage you to check your driving record for any violations that may have been fraudulently reported under your name.\nDriving records cost $8 and can be requested online.\nRequest Your Driving Record Online\nOther Resources and Contacts\nSocial Security Administration\nFraud Report: 800-269-0271\nFederal Trade Commission\nOversees the credit bureaus and maintains a database of identity thefts\n202-382-4357\nU.S. Postal Service\nInvestigates mail fraud\nPostal Inspector: 800-275-8777",
