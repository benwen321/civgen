Proof of your SSN is not required if you know the number and DMV is able to electronically verify it.\nNew Residents\nWithin 60 days of moving to Virginia, you must obtain a Virginia driver's license. If you currently hold a commercial driver's license (CDL), you must obtain a Virginia CDL within 30 days.\nIf you currently hold a driver\u2019s license from outside the U.S., see\nExchanging a Foreign Driver\u2019s License\n.\nMilitary Personnel\nActive-duty members of the\nArmed Forces\nstationed in Virginia: You, your spouse and dependent children 16 years and 3 months of age or older may drive with a valid driver's license issued by your home state or country.\nIf you are the sole owner of the vehicle: It may be driven with valid out-of-state license plates.\nIf the vehicle is co-owned and out-of-state plates are used: All co-owners must be active duty members of the Armed Forces. If all the co-owners are not active duty members, the vehicle must be registered in Virginia. You may register your vehicle in Virginia without obtaining a Virginia driver's license.\nOut-of-State Students\nIf you are enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited school in Virginia and are not employed, you may drive in Virginia with a valid out-of-state (or another country) driver's license and valid out-of-state license plates on your vehicle.\nIf you are a full-time student and employed, you are considered a resident of Virginia for the purposes of motor vehicle laws only. This does not necessarily qualify you for in-state tuition rates, so you must apply for a Virginia driver's license and register your vehicle in Virginia. You must register the vehicle in Virginia even if it is owned by someone else.\nNon-Residents\nIf you are a non-resident temporarily living in Virginia, you may drive with your home state or country\u2019s driver's license and license plates for no more than six months. Note: This does not apply to commercial vehicle drivers. If you become gainfully employed, you are required to hold a Virginia driver's license.\nIf you are serving a full-time church service or proselytizing mission for not more than 36 months, are not gainfully employed and the owner(s) of a vehicle that is titled and registered in another state, you are not required to title or register your vehicle in Virginia.\nFor more information, visit your local DMV\ncustomer service center\nor\ncontact us\n.\nIdentification and Residency Requirements\nEach time you apply for a driver's license, learner's permit or CDL (or on each return visit until your license is issued), you must present the following documents proving your eligibility:\nOne proof of identity\nOne proof of legal presence\nTwo proofs of Virginia residency\nOne proof of your Social Security number (SSN), if you have been issued one (required for CDL)\nCurrent driver's license if you are applying to exchange one issued by another U.S. state, territory or jurisdiction for a Virginia driver's license\nProof of name change if your name appears differently on your proof documents\nYou will not be required to present proof of your SSN if you know the number and DMV is able to electronically verify it.\nYour name must appear the same on all proof documents. Nicknames will NOT be accepted. If your name appears differently on your proof documents, you will be asked to present additional documentation.\nAll documents must be originals and are subject to verification; temporary documents and photocopies of documents are not accepted. We will not accept a document when there\u2019s reason to believe it is illegitimate. DMV may require additional documents or change which documents are accepted without prior notice.\nYou may hold either a driver's license, or a CDL, but not both. If you hold a license of any kind, you are not eligible for an ID card.\nResources\nApplying for a Driver's License\nObtaining a Motorcycle License\nApplying for a Commercial Driver's License or Commercial Learner's Permit\nCDL Skills Test Eligibility Requirements\nReinstating Driving Privileges",
