    "text_content": "DMV implemented a service that enables us to electronically certify and verify customer birth records. This service uses a computer system called Electronic Verification of Vital Events (EVVE), developed by the National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS). Through this service, DMV is able to immediately serve customers who need to document their legal presence to obtain a DMV credential but who do not have a copy of their birth certificate available. For more information, see\nLegal Presence\n.\nDMV offers this service through DMV\u2019s customer service centers (CSCs) and through DMV\u2019s website. At a CSC, customers complete an application and provide proof of identity. Once identity is confirmed, DMV checks for the birth record in the EVVE system. If a birth record match is found, the customer\u2019s DMV record is automatically marked as having proven legal presence and the customer is required to pay a certification fee that is charged by the birth state (note: fees vary by state).\nCustomers may also access EVVE through DMV\u2019s website. The website requires a DMV Personal Identification Number (PIN) and personal information, such as name, address, birth state and mother\u2019s maiden name. If EVVE finds a match, customers pay a fee for their birth certification just like they do in the CSC. The online certification documents legal presence in DMV\u2019s records only.\nIf customers require a physical copy of the birth certificate, they should contact their birth state\u2019s vital record agency or if Virginia-born, visit a\nCSC\nor the\nVirginia Department of Health/Vital Records\ninstead of using Online EVVE.\nParticipating States/Jurisdictions and Birth Year Range\nState/jurisdiction vital record agencies must agree to participate in EVVE. So a customer\u2019s birth state/jurisdiction may or may not participate. In addition, vital record agencies have different ranges of birth years that are available through EVVE.\nThe following list shows the states/jurisdictions that participate and the available birth year ranges.\nState/Jurisdiction Availability by Service Option\nState/Jurisdiction\nMust be born IN or AFTER\nEVVE in Customer Service Center\nEVVE Online\nStates\nAlabama (AL)\n1930\nYes\nYes\nAlaska (AK)\n1890\nYes\nNo\nArkansas (AR)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nArizona (AZ)\n1935\nYes\nNo\nCalifornia (CA)\n1905\nYes\nNo\nColorado (CO)\n1903\nYes\nYes\nConnecticut (CT)\n1988\nYes\nNo\nDelaware (DE)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nGeorgia (GA)\n1989\nYes\nYes\nHawaii (HI)\n1909\nYes\nYes\nIdaho (ID)\n1911\nYes\nNo\nIllinois (IL)\n1985\nYes\nNo\nIndiana (IN)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nIowa (IA)\n1930\nYes\nYes\nKansas (KS)\n1911\nYes\nYes\nKentucky (KY)\n1911\nYes\nNo\nLouisiana (LA)\n1916\nYes\nYes\nMaine (ME)\n1988\nYes\nYes\nMassachusetts (MA)\n1953-2010\nYes\nYes\nMichigan (MI)\n1989\nYes\nYes\nMinnesota (MN)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nMississippi (MS)\n1912\nYes\nYes\nMissouri (MO)\n1920\nYes\nYes\nMontana (MT)\n1920\nYes\nYes\nNew Hampshire (NH)\n1982\nYes\nYes\nNew Jersey (NJ)\n1965\nYes\nYes\nNew Mexico (NM)\n1868\nYes\nNo\nNevada (NV)\n1983\nYes\nYes\nNorth Dakota (ND)\n1870\nYes\nYes\nOhio (OH)\n1909\nYes\nYes\nOklahoma (OK)\n1947\nYes\nYes\nOregon (OR)\n1920\nYes\nNo\nPennsylvania (PA)\n1921\nYes\nNo\nRhode Island (RI)\n1940\nYes\nNo\nSouth Dakota (SD)\n1905\nYes\nNo\nTennessee (TN)\n1976\nYes\nYes\nUtah (UT)\n1951\nYes\nNo\nVermont (VT)\n1909\nYes\nYes\nVirginia (VA)\n1912\nNo\nYes\nWest Virginia (WV)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nWisconsin (WI)\n1979\nYes\nYes\nWyoming (WY)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nJurisdictions\nDistrict of Columbia (DC)\n1935\nYes\nYes\nNew York City (YC)\n1920\nYes\nYes\nPuerto Rico (PR)\n1931\nYes\nNo",
