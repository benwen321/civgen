The cost of a child ID card is $2 per year (minimum $10; maximum $16).\nIn addition to serving as an identity document, the child\u2019s photograph is stored in DMV\u2019s database. If the child becomes missing, DMV can retrieve the image from the database and transmit it to law enforcement anywhere in the U. S.\nChild ID cards will expire on the last day of the customer\u2019s month of birth in a year when they reach an age divisible by 5 (such as 5, 10, 15,) unless the child is authorized to be in the US for a limited duration period. Child ID cards issued to children age 13 or 14 will expire on their 16 birthday.\nApplicants for a Child ID Card must appear in-person at a DMV customer service center (for both originals and replacements).\nGetting a Child ID Card\nChild ID cards:\nRequire one identity document for the child, such as a birth certificate or unexpired U.S. passport, along with proof of the child\u2019s social security number, if one has been issued.\nUse the interactive\nDocument Guide\nto determine which documents you will need to bring to DMV, or refer to \"Acceptable Documents for Obtaining a Driver's License or Photo ID Card\" (\nDMV 141\n).\nEn espa\n\u00f1\nol\nThe parent must certify the child's identity and residency using the Identification Card Application for Minors (\nDL5\n).\nIf the child's name appears on the parent's legal presence document, that document governs the expiration date of the child's legal presence.\nTo find out more about the requirements and the application process for an ID card, refer to\nGet an Identification Card\n.\nWhat Is Displayed on a Child ID Card\nThe child ID card contains the following:\nCustomer number\nDate of birth, height and sex\nExpiration date and issue date\nFull legal name and address\nFull-face photograph\nStatement \"Not a license to operate a motor vehicle\"\nStatement \"Organ donor information\"\nMedical Indicators on Child ID Cards\nA parent or legal guardian submitting a signed physician statement may voluntarily request indicators be placed on their child\u2019s ID card as a means of identifying their\ncondition/impairment\nto law enforcement personnel.
