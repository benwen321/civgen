You may hold either a driver's license, or ID card, but not both. If you hold a license of any kind, you must surrender it before applying for an ID card.\nWhat is REAL ID?\nBeginning May 7, 2025, the federal government will require you to present a REAL ID compliant credential, or another federally approved form of ID, in order to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility.\nAll applicants for a REAL ID compliant credential, including current Virginia credential holders, must visit DMV in-person to provide physical documentation. As the May 2025 enforcement deadline for REAL ID approaches, DMV offices are expected to become increasingly busy, so beat the rush and upgrade now. For more information, visit\nREAL ID\nor\nREAL ID: You Have a REAL Choice\n.\nRequired Documents\nIf you are applying for an ID card and do not hold a valid Virginia driver's license, you must present the following documents proving your eligibility:\nOne proof of identity\nOne proof of legal presence\nTwo proofs of Virginia residency\nOne proof of your Social Security number, if you have been issued one\nProof of name change if your name appears differently on your proof documents\nTo determine which documents to bring to DMV when you apply, use the interactive\nDocument Guide\n, or review the DMV publication \"Obtaining a Driver's License or ID Card\" (\nDMV 141\n) (\nen espa\u00f1ol\n).\nProof of your Social Security number is not required if you know the number and DMV is able to electronically verify it.\nYour name must appear the same on all proof documents. Nicknames will NOT be accepted. If your name appears differently on your proof documents, you will need to present additional documentation.\nAll documents must be originals and will be subject to verification; however, print-outs of online residency documents that are listed on Form DMV 141 are acceptable as proof of residency. Temporary documents and photocopies of documents will not be accepted. DMV will not accept a document when there\u2019s reason to believe it is not legitimate. DMV may require additional documents or change which documents are accepted without prior notice.\nCompleting the Application\nIf you are applying for an adult ID card or a\nhearing-impaired ID card\n, you must complete the Driver's License or Identification Card Application (Form DL 1P)\nonline\nor on\npaper\n.\nFor a\nchild ID card\n(under age 15), complete the Application for an Identification Card for Minors Under 15 (form\nDL 5\n).\nUse your full legal name on the application. Abbreviations and nicknames will not be accepted.

ID cards are valid for a maximum of eight years.\nChild ID\ncards will expire on the last day of the customer\u2019s month of birth in a year when they reach an age divisible by 5 (such as 5, 10, 15.)\nIf you are authorized to be in the U.S. TEMPORARILY, you will be issued an ID card valid only for the amount of time that you are legally permitted to stay in the U.S. You will not be eligible to receive a limited duration ID card if your authorized stay in the U.S. is less than 30 days from the date of your application. The expiration of the ID card will be the same as the expiration date shown on the document used to prove\nlegal presence\n. If the document does not show an expiration date, the ID card will be valid for one year.\nIndividuals required to register with the Virginia State Police Sex Offender and Crimes Against Children registry (\nVa. Code \u00a7 9.1\n) will be issued ID cards valid for five years.\nGetting Your ID Card\nYour ID card will be securely mailed to your address on file. If you have moved, notify DMV right away, as the U.S. Postal Service does not forward IDs. If you have renewed your ID card, continue to carry your old ID card with your receipt until you receive your new ID card.\nAdditional Information\nSee our\nPhotograph Policy\n.\nSee\nSelective Service\nregistration information.\nMedical Indicators\nAn applicant, or parent or legal guardian if the applicant is under 18, may request indicators be placed on their learner\u2019s permit to identify their\ncondition/impairment\nto law enforcement.
