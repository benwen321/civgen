Visit www.tax.virginia.gov for Virginia income tax return filing information.\nAll documents must be original and will be subject to verification; however, print-outs of online residency documents that are listed on Form\nDMV 309\nare acceptable as proof of residency. Temporary documents and photocopies of documents will not be accepted. DMV will not accept a document as proof of identity, legal presence, residency, or social security number when there is reason to believe it has been altered, fraudulently obtained or is fake, forged, counterfeit, or otherwise non-genuine or illegitimate.\nDocuments accepted by DMV as proof of identity, Virginia residency, and social security number may change without prior notice. DMV may require additional documents. If you have official documentation, not listed below, that you believe meets DMV requirements, please present it to your local DMV office for review.\nUpon issuance of an ID privilege card in the Commonwealth of Virginia, any driver's license, driver privilege card, commercial driver's license, or ID card previously issued by another state must be surrendered and will be cancelled by the issuing state.\nYou may hold either a driver privilege card, or an ID privilege card, but not both. If you hold a license of any kind, you must surrender it before applying for an ID privilege card.\nSelective Service Registration\nGenerally, males under age 26 must register with the Selective Service. If you are required by federal law to register with the Selective Service, you must authorize DMV to forward your personal information to the Selective Service unless you have already registered.\nIf you are under age 18\n, your parent or guardian must sign your application authorizing the Selective Service to register you when you turn age 18.\nDMV is prohibited by law from issuing any type of driver's license or ID card to an applicant who is required by federal law to register with the Selective Service but who refuses to authorize DMV to send his information to the Selective Service. If you have questions about Selective Service registration, visit the Selective Service website at\nwww.sss.gov\nor call 847-688-6888 (TTY: 847-688-2567).\nCompleting the Application\nIf you are applying for an ID privilege card, you must complete an Application for a Driver Privilege Card or Identification Privilege Card (form\nDL 10\n).\nFor a child ID privilege card (under age 15), complete the application for an Identification Privilege Card for Minors Under 15 (form\nDL 23\n).\nYou may complete these forms before or during your visit to DMV. Use your full legal name on the application. Abbreviations and nicknames will not be accepted. For your convenience, you may indicate your desire to become an\norgan donor\nwhen you apply for your ID privilege card.\nFee\nAn ID privilege card or child ID privilege card costs $25.00. You may pay with cash, money order, check, check card or major credit card.\nLength of Time an ID Card is Valid\nIf you are 16 or older, your first ID privilege card will expire on your birthday in the fourth year of ID card validity. All subsequent issuances will be valid for four years from the date of issuance.\nGetting Your ID Card\nYou will receive your ID privilege card in the mail, so make sure DMV has your current, correct address on record. The U.S. Postal Service will not forward ID privilege cards, so notify DMV right away if you have moved.\nDMV will assign you a customer number which will display on your ID privilege card. If you wish to change your DMV-assigned number in the future, you may be required to present documentation from law enforcement or the courts indicating that you may be a victim of identity theft.\nPhotographs\nDMV may refuse to issue a credential to any applicant who appears for photographing in a disguise or intentionally distorts their face to alter their appearance.\nMedical Indicators\nAn applicant or parent or legal guardian (if applicant is under 18), submitting a signed physician statement may voluntarily request indicators be placed on the applicant's ID privilege card as a means of identifying their\ncondition/impairment\nto law enforcement personnel. A \"9\" will display in the restriction field on the face of the ID privilege card and will be decoded on the back as follows:\nInsulin-dependent diabetic\nSpeech impairment\nHearing impairment\nIntellectual disability (IntD will display)\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD will display)\nBlind or vision impaired\nTraumatic brain injury\nBlood Type Designation\nConsider displaying your blood type on your identification privilege card.\nObtaining a Child ID Card\nA parent or a legal guardian can obtain a child identification privilege card for their child under age 15. Applicants for a child identification privilege card must appear in-person at a DMV customer service center. The cost of a child identification privilege card is $25.\nA parent or legal guardian must present the following when applying:\nOne identity document for the child\nProof of the child's social security number (if they have been issued one) or their individual taxpayer identification number\nProof of a parent or legal guardian's identification and two proofs of Virginia residency from the residency list\nUse the interactive\nDocument Guide\nto determine which documents you will need to bring to DMV, or refer to \"Obtaining a Driver Privilege Card or Identification Privilege Card\" (\nDMV 309\n).\nA child ID privilege card issued to an applicant under the age of 15 will be valid for four years, unless the applicant is 13 or older, then the applicant's ID privilege card will expire on their 16th birthday. While a child's first ID privilege card will expire on their birthday, all subsequent issuances will be valid for four years from the date of issuance.\nIn addition to serving as an identity document, the child\u2019s photograph is stored in DMV\u2019s database. If the child becomes missing, DMV can retrieve the image from the database and transmit it to law enforcement anywhere in the U.S.",
