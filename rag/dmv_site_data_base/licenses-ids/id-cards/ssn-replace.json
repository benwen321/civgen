    "text_content": "You may now be able to order a replacement Social Security card online, thanks to a partnership between the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the Social Security Administration.\nVirginians and residents of other participating states who meet a few basic requirements may visit\nssa.gov\nto submit their application online. Social Security compares the submitted information with DMV and other records and, upon verification, mails the customer a new card. Participants must have a U.S. domestic mailing address and a valid driver\u2019s license or identification card, and must not need to change their name or make other record revisions.",
