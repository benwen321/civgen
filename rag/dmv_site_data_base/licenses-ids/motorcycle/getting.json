The designation indicates the type(s) of motorcycles you may operate:\nM: Both two and three-wheeled motorcycles\nM2: Only two-wheeled motorcycles\nM3: Only three-wheeled motorcycles\nMost motorcyclists are licensed to operate both a motorcycle and a motor vehicle; however, if your license displays both an \"M\", \"M2\", or \"M3\" designation\nand\na \"6\" listed under \"Restriction,\" you may\nonly\noperate a motorcycle and may not operate a motor vehicle.\nAdding the Class M Designation to Your License\nIf you already hold a valid Virginia driver's license without a motorcycle designation, you may add a Class M, M2 or M3 designation to your license that will allow you to operate a motorcycle.\nNote: Not all DMV customer service centers offer the motorcycle road skills test, so check the list of test locations before you decide to take the test.\nSteps\nIf you are 18 or older\nPass the required\nvision screening\nPass a\nVirginia Rider Training Program\ncourse\nHold a\nmotorcycle learner's permit\nfor 30 days\nOR\nPass the required\nvision screening\nPass the\nmotorcycle knowledge exam\nHold a\nmotorcycle learner's permit\nfor 30 days\nPass the\nmotorcycle road skills test\nIf you complete a\nVirginia Rider Training Program\ncourse, you will receive a course completion certificate and will\nnot\nneed to complete the motorcycle knowledge exam or road skills test.\nIf you are 19 or older,\nthe course completion certificate acts as a temporary M2 or M3 classification when carried with your driver's license.\nThis allows you to operate the appropriate motorcycle for 30 days from the course completion date.\nAfter the initial 30 days, you will not be authorized to operate a motorcycle until you visit a DMV\ncustomer service center\nto have the motorcycle designation added to your license. Certificates are valid for one year from the date of completion. Make sure to bring the certificate of completion with you when you visit DMV to apply for your motorcycle classification.\nIf you are under 18\nPass the required\nvision screening\nPass a\nVirginia Rider Training Program\ncourse\nHold a\nmotorcycle learner's permit\nfor 9 months\nOR\nPass the required\nvision screening\nPass the\nmotorcycle knowledge exam\nHold a\nmotorcycle learner's permit\nfor 9 months\nPass the\nmotorcycle road skills test\nIf you provide DMV with a\nVirginia Rider Training Program\ncertificate of completion, you are still required to hold a motorcycle learner's permit for nine months; however, you are exempt from taking the motorcycle knowledge exam and the motorcycle road skills test for a period of one year from the date of course completion.\nThe motorcycle class has an annual fee and is valid for the same period of time as your driver's license. When you renew your driver's license, remember to renew your Class M, M2 or M3 designation as well. Refer to the\nDMV Fee Chart\nto see the yearly charge.\nDriver's License Restricted to Operating a Motorcycle\nYou may get a driver's license that allows you to operate\nonly\na motorcycle, as indicated by the \"6\" added to Restrictions on your license.\nIn addition to the above requirements for adding a motorcycle designation to a driver's license, you must pass the two-part\ndriver's license knowledge exam\n.\nThe motorcycle-only driver's license costs $6 per year and is normally valid for 8 years. If you decide later that you want a regular driver's license, you will have to pass only the driver road skills test. See\nApply for a License\nfor more information.\nIf you are under 18\n, you must provide proof of successful completion of an\napproved driver education program\nbefore receiving any Virginia driver's license, including a motorcycle-only license. This is a separate requirement from the Virginia Rider Training Program.\nOut-Of-State License Holders\nIf you hold a valid out-of-state driver's license and complete the\nVirginia Rider Training Program\n, you will\nnot\nbe eligible for a Virginia motorcycle-only license. Virginia law prohibits you from holding both your out-of-state license and any type of Virginia license. However, you may be able to\nexchange your out-of-state driver's license\nfor a Virginia license and get the appropriate Class M, M2 or M3 designation.\nIf you hold a valid out-of-state driver's license and possess an out-of-state motorcycle safety course certificate but do not have a motorcycle class designation on your license, you are\nnot\neligible for a Virginia Class M designation. Virginia does not accept out-of-state motorcycle safety course certificates. To receive a Class M, M2 or M3 designation, you must pass the motorcycle knowledge and road skills tests and hold a motorcycle learner's permit for 30 days. If you are under 18, you will need to hold a motorcycle learner's permit for 9 months.\nMembers of the Military\nSee\nOut-for-State Motorcycle Classification\nfor information.\nResources\nVirginia Rider Training Program\nMoving to or from Virginia?\nMotorcycle Safety",
