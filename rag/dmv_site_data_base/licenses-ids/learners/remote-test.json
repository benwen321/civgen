    "text_content": "DMV's remote testing program is a partnership with the Department of Education and private schools. Using web-based technology, students can access the DMV knowledge test in a proctored setting at their schools, instead of having a parent take them to a DMV office. Students immediately receive their test results. Upon successful completion, students are issued a \"testing receipt\" to take to a DMV customer service center for processing.\nThere is no cost to the schools to participate. Schools just need a computer lab with Internet access and a staff member to proctor the exams. DMV will set up the program and help train staff.\nParticipating Schools and Localities\nBelow are many of the localities and schools taking advantage of DMV's remote testing:\nAccomack County - Arcadia and Chincoteague High Schools\nAlbemarle County - Albemarle High School\nAmelia County - Amelia County High School\nArlington County - Wakefield High School\nAugusta County - Fort Defiance, Riverheads, Stuarts Draft and Wilson Memorial High Schools\nBath County - Bath County High School\nBland County - Bland County High School\nBotetourt County - James River High School, Lord Botetourt High\nBristol City - Virginia High School\nBuchanan County - Council, Grundy, Hurley and Twin Valley High Schools\nCharlottesville City - Charlottesville High School\nChesterfield County - Bird, Carver College & Career Academy, Clover Hill, Cosby, James River, Manchester, Matoaca, Meadowbrook, Midlothian, Monacan and Thomas Dale High Schools\nCraig County - Craig County High School\nTown of Colonial Beach - Colonial Beach High School\nCulpeper County - Culpeper and Eastern View High Schools\nCumberland County - Cumberland County High School\nDanville City - Galileo Magnet High School\nDinwiddie County - Dinwiddie High School\nEssex County - St. Margaret's School\nFairfax County - Annandale, Bryant, Centreville, Chantilly, Edison, Fairfax, Falls Church, Hayfield Secondary, Herndon, Justice, Lake Braddock, Langley, Lewis, Madison, Marshall, McLean, Mount Vernon, Oakton, Robinson Secondary, South County, South Lakes, Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology, West Potomac, West Springfield, Westfield and Woodson High Schools and Pimmit Hills and Plum Centers\nFluvanna County - Fluvanna County High School\nFranklin County - Franklin County High School\nGloucester County - Gloucester High School\nGoochland County - Goochland High School\nGreensville County - Greensville County High School\nHampton City - Bethel and Kecoughtan High Schools\nHanover County - Mechanicsville High School\nHarrisonburg City - Harrisonburg High School\nHenrico County - Deep Run, Freeman, Glen Allen, Godwin, Henrico, Hermitage, Highland Springs, Tucker and Varina High Schools and The Academy at Virginia Randolph\nHenry County - Bassett and Magna Vista High Schools\nHopewell City - Hopewell High School\nLee County - Lee High School\nLoudoun County - Dominion, Freedom, Heritage, John Champe, Loudoun County, Park View, Potomac Falls, Rock Ridge, Stone Bridge and Woodgrove High Schools\nLunenburg County - Central High School\nMadison County - Madison County High School\nManassas Park City - Manassas Park High School\nMontgomery County - Auburn, Blacksburg, Christiansburg, and Eastern Montgomery High Schools\nNewport News City - Achievable Dream, Denbigh, Heritage, Menchville, Point Option, Warwick and Woodside High Schools\nNorfolk City - Booker T.
