    "text_content": "Driver education programs help you gain the skills and experience needed to pass your driving test and build lifelong good driving habits. They are available statewide to residents of all ages.\nThe program includes 36 classroom sessions, seven driving sessions, seven observation sessions and a final road skills examination. Each session is 50 minutes long.\nCompleting a driver education program gets you a completion certificate, which most new drivers need to qualify for a permanent driver's license.\nWhere Do I Take Driver Education?\nWho Is Required to Take Driver Education?\n90-Minute Parent/Teen Component\nExchanging Your Out-of-State License\nWhere Do I Take Driver Education?\nDriver education programs may be taken at a public or private school, or at a\ndriver training school\n. The classroom component may also be taken\nonline\nthrough a driver training school.\nFind a Driver Training School Near You\nIf you are home-schooled, see\nDriver Education for Home-Schooled Students\n.\nWho Is Required to Take Driver Education?\nIf you are a Virginia resident under 18 years old\n, before you can get your driver's license, you must hold your Virginia learner's permit for at least nine months and complete a Commonwealth of Virginia-approved driver education program.\nIf you are a Virginia resident UNDER 18 years old and you move to Virginia from another U.S. state or territory with a valid learner\u2019s permit\n, the time you held your learner's permit will be counted toward the Virginia minimum holding period.\nIf, while holding your out of state learner\u2019s permit, you completed an out-of-state driver education program, the out-of-state program must provide proof you have completed at least 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of in-car instruction.\nNote: Your parent, guardian or foster parent must provide their driver's license or state-issued identification card number and sign the driver education completion certificate, which attests to your academic standing and certifies that you have driven at least 45 hours (15 of which occurred after sunset).\nIf you are a Virginia resident age 18 or older\nand have never held a license issued by any state, U.S. territory or foreign country, there are two options to get your driver's license.\nOption 1:\nComplete a driver education program and pass the driver's license\nknowledge exam\n.\nYou are required to apply for and receive a learner's permit.\u00a0However, completing driver education, including the end of course skills exam, waives the mandatory 60-day holding period and taking a DMV- administered skills exam.\nOption 2:\nHold a Virginia learner's permit for at least 60 days and complete a\nBehind-the-Wheel Checklist\nbefore taking the\nroad skills test\nat DMV.\nThis waives the need for a driver education program. However, a licensed driver must certify they were with you while you practiced, and that you have complied with all requirements for learner's permit holders while operating a motor vehicle.\n90-Minute Parent/Teen Component\nFor students under 18, there is an additional 90-minute parent/teen component to the classroom portion of the driver education curriculum. It covers topics such as juvenile driving restrictions and the dangers of driving while intoxicated.\nYou are\nexempt\nfrom the 90-minute parent/teen component if you are:\nat least 18 years old\nan emancipated minor\nan unaccompanied minor who is not in the physical custody of your parent or guardian\nWhat is an unaccompanied minor?\nAn unaccompanied minor is a minor who may be separated from their parents and living with others who do not have custody for a variety of reasons.\nAfter an unaccompanied minor has completed their training, they must check the appropriate box on the\nVirginia Driver Training Certificate\nof Classroom Completion regarding the exemption from the parent/teen component and sign the certificate before the license can be processed.\nExchanging Your Out-of-State License (Juvenile Applicants Only)\nDMV may exchange your out-of-state license for a Virginia license if you meet the following conditions:\nYou are at least age 16 and three months but under age 18 and hold a valid license\nYou have successfully completed a driver education program while residing in another state, and the program meets a minimum of 30 classroom hours and six in-car instruction hours\nYou can present\nall documents required\nfor the driver's license or driver privilege card you are applying for. See our\nInteractive Document Guide\nfor more guidance.\nIf you hold a current out-of-state driver's license but do not have proof of driver education, you may be issued a Virginia six-month temporary license. This will give you time to get proof or complete a state-approved driver education program.",
