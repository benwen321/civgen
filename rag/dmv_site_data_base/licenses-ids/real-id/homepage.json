However, if you do want one, we encourage you to apply as soon as possible.\nStandard License vs REAL ID License\nApplicable Uses\nStandard License\nREAL ID License\nDrive\nYes\nYes\nVote or register to vote\nYes\nYes\nVerify your identity at banks, utility companies and retail stores\nYes\nYes\nApply for or receive federal benefits\nYes\nYes\nAccess health or life preserving services\nYes\nYes\nEnter federal facilities requiring ID*\nNo\nYes\nAccess military bases*\nNo\nYes\nBoard domestic flights beginning May 7, 2025\nNo\nYes\n* Secure federal facilities and military bases have the authority to set their own identification requirements.

See\nfee chart\n.\nNote: For example, a standard driver's license renewal costs $32, while a standard driver's license replacement costs $20.\nSee\nacceptable documents guide\n.\nNote: All documents must be originals and will be subject to verification. However, printouts of acceptable\nonline residency documents\ncan be used as proof of residency. Temporary documents and photocopies of documents will not be accepted.\nFor First-time Driver's License/ID Applicants in Virginia\nYou can choose to make your license/ID a REAL ID when applying.\nStep 1: Application\nStart the application online\nbefore visiting a customer service center\nor\nFill out a paper application at a\ncustomer service center\nStep 2: Bring required documents to the DMV.

Customers should not submit any images of personal documents to such websites, as they will not be sent to DMV and could be used for fraudulent purposes.\nYou may fill out a\nREAL ID application in advance\n. However, this process will not ask you to scan and upload documents.\nREAL ID Is Optional for Virginians\nVirginia does not require you to get a REAL ID compliant license or ID card. If you stick with a standard license or ID, it will display \"Federal Limits Apply\" the next time you renew.\nBeginning May 7, 2025\n, if you do not get a REAL ID, you must have an alternate form of federally accepted identification (valid U. S. passport, U.S. Department of Defense ID, Transportation Worker Identification Credential, etc.) to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility or military base.\nSee the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s full list of\nfederally accepted identification\n.\nNote: Secure federal facilities and military bases set their own identification requirements. Please verify requirements prior to your visit. Effective immediately, some military bases may no longer accept non-REAL ID compliant credentials, which display \"Federal Limits Apply.\"\nHave more questions?\nGet answers at\nREAL ID FAQs\n.\nWant this info in pamphlet form?\nSee our printable\nREAL ID brochure\n.",
