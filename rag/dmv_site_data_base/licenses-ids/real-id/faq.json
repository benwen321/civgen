Current Virginia driver\u2019s license and identification card holders may choose at renewal whether they would like a REAL ID compliant credential or a standard Virginia credential. If a customer chooses not to apply for a REAL ID compliant credential, the customer\u2019s renewal process remains the same as in previous years. If you are a renewal customer and want to upgrade to REAL ID, you can start your REAL ID application online. This easy and efficient process will also help you select which documents to bring to DMV.Start your application now.\nCan I use my current driver\u2019s license or ID card to board a domestic flight?\nYes, until May 7, 2025. Your current Virginia credential may be used to board a domestic flight through May 6, 2025. On May 7, 2025, the federal government will require all domestic air travelers to present a REAL ID compliant driver\u2019s license or ID card or another federally approved form of identification.\nIf I do not have a REAL ID compliant credential, what can I use to board a domestic air flight beginning May 7, 2025?\nThe Transportation Security Administration indicates that it will accept the following identification documents:\nDoes my minor child need a REAL ID compliant credential in order to board a plane beginning May 7, 2025?\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration does not require children under age 18 to provide identification when traveling with a companion within the United States. The companion will need acceptable identification. Please note that airlines may have individual policies on minor children and require identification.\nIs a REAL ID compliant license or ID card necessary to get into every federal facility?\nNo. REAL ID does not apply to the following:\nIf I do not have a REAL ID compliant credential, what can I use to enter a federal facility when identification requirements change?\nDHS has not released an approved documents list for entrance into federal facilities. Many federal facilities may have control over acceptable identification documents for entrance. If you are looking to enter a specific facility, DMV suggests contacting that facility directly.Effective immediately,some military bases may no longer accept non-REAL ID compliant credentials which display \u201cFederal Limits Apply.\u201d Please verify identification requirements prior to your visit.\nI need to visit a military base.

Please verify identification requirements prior to your visit.\nHow do I apply for a REAL ID compliant license or ID card?\nThe process is similar to Virginia\u2019s current driver\u2019s license/ID card application process. All applicants for a REAL ID compliant credential, including current Virginia credential holders, must apply in-person, pay a one-time $10 REAL ID surcharge in addition to standard fees and provide DMV with physical documentation of:\nWhat do I do if the name or other information on my birth certificate does not match the information on my driver\u2019s license or ID card?\nMany people change their names due to marriage, adoption, divorce or other reasons. In order to obtain a REAL ID compliant credential, you must provide proof documents that show a direct link between your name changes. Those documents include a marriage certificate filed with a government agency or court, divorce decree, or a court order granting the name change. Marriage licenses, civil union documents, and marriage certificates signed only by the wedding officiant (for example, a member of the clergy) will NOT be accepted.\nWhat does a REAL ID compliant license/ID card look like?\nREAL ID compliant licenses and ID cards look the same as cards issued prior to October 1, 2018, except they have a circle with a star in the top right corner of the credential, while non-compliant licenses and ID cards display \u201cFederal Limits Apply\u201d on the face of the card.\nWhen should I apply for a REAL ID compliant license or ID card?\nDon\u2019t wait! DMV will become increasingly busy the closer it gets to the federal enforcement deadline of May 2025. Check the expiration date on your credential. You can renew up to one year in advance of expiration. If it is time to renew, consider coming to DMV as soon as possible if you want to get a REAL ID. If you don\u2019t need to renew for several years, you can come in any time and request a replacement credential. Save yourself time and get REAL ID ready now!\nCan I still get a REAL ID if my driver\u2019s license or ID card doesn\u2019t expire for several years?\nYes! Please visit DMV in person with the required REAL ID documentation and request a replacement credential. You\u2019ll pay the standard replacement card fee ($20 for a driver\u2019s license; $10 for an ID card), plus a $10 one-time surcharge for REAL ID. Save yourself time and get REAL ID ready now!\nCan I renew online and still get a REAL ID compliant credential?\nNo. Federal law requires that your first application for a REAL ID compliant credential be made in person. After you\u2019ve received your first REAL ID compliant credential, you may renew online according to the standard schedule.\nWhat do I do if I can\u2019t find my birth certificate or marriage certificate?\nIf you were born or married in Virginia, you can request a certified copy of these documents at any of DMV\u2019s 75 customer service centers. Please seeVital Records at DMVfor more information. If you were born, married or divorced in another state, you can request a certified copy of these documents from the state in which they were issued.\nCan I scan my documents in advance?\nVirginia DMV does not have a process by which customers can pre-scan and upload REAL ID documents from home. In order to get a REAL ID, you must bring your documents to Virginia DMV for review. Any website claiming to provide this service is not affiliated with Virginia DMV. As such, customers should not submit any images of personal documents to such websites as they will not be transmitted to Virginia DMV and could be used for fraudulent purposes. Customers may fill out aREAL ID application in advance; however, this process will not ask you to scan and upload documents.\nHow do you secure my scanned documents?\nThe federal REAL ID Act requires states to maintain copies of all customer proof documents presented as part of a REAL ID application. The security of customer documentation and records is of the utmost importance to DMV and the agency follows the highest security standards. As such, REAL ID documents are scanned and securely stored in an encrypted format and DMV access to those records is heavily restricted.\nAre the non-compliant driver\u2019s license and ID card less secure than the REAL ID compliant credential?\nBoth are secure. Virginia completely overhauled its driver\u2019s licenses and IDs in 2009 to include the security features present in your current credential. The only physical difference between compliant and non-compliant cards is the marking in the top right corner of the credential. To meet the requirements of the REAL ID Act, compliant cards display a circle with a small star while non-compliant cards display \u201cFederal Limits Apply.\u201d",
