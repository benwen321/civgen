You receive DEMERIT points\nfor unsafe driving and SAFE DRIVING points for good driving.\nDemerit Points\nDemerit points are assigned when you are convicted of a traffic violation. The demerit points associated with a conviction remain valid for two years from the date you commit the offense.\nDemerit points can add up. Each time you commit a traffic offense, DMV adds additional demerit points to your record. This can add up to big trouble for some drivers.\nDifferent violations carry different point assignments, depending on the seriousness of the offense.
