    "text_content": "Organ transplantation is one of the most remarkable success stories in the history of medicine. In most cases, it's the only hope for thousands of people suffering from organ failure or in desperate need of corneas, skin, bone or other tissue.\nTragically, the need for donated organs and tissues continues to outpace the supply. Right now, thousands of Americans could be helped if enough organs and tissues were available. Organ and tissue donation provides each of us with a special opportunity to help others.\nYou can save lives by making the decision to be an organ and tissue donor.\nWhen you apply for a driver's license, driver privilege card, learner's permit or photo ID card, you will be asked if you wish to become an organ, eye and tissue donor. If you decide to become a donor, your choice will be noted on the front of your driver's license or photo ID card.\nIf you wish to change your organ donor status later, go to\nDonate Life Virginia\n. To change the status on your credential, apply for a replacement\ndriver\u2019s license\n,\ndriver privilege card\nor\nID card\n. You may complete this transaction online or you may make the change as part of your next\ndriver's license\n,\ndriver privilege card\nor\nID card\nrenewal.\nThe decision to become an organ/tissue donor is yours. Your decision will not affect your driving privileges.\nYou can\nsave eight lives through organ donation and improve the lives of more than 75 others through eye and tissue donation.\nOnce you have made your decision,\nshare it with your family\n.\nFor more information, contact:\nDonate Life Virginia\n9200 Arboretum Parkway, Suite 104\nRichmond, VA 23236\n1-866-VADonor (1-866-823-6667)",
