    "text_content": "The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) may certify a DMV-licensed Class A Driver Training School to be a Third Party Tester. As a third party tester, the driver training school will be able to conduct the pre-trip inspection and road skills examination for individuals receiving classroom and in-vehicle training from their school to obtain a commercial driver\u2019s license. It allows them to test their students on-site without having to send the student driver, commercial vehicle and trainer to a DMV Customer Service Center for testing.\nParticipating schools will be required to submit the results of each skills test administered in a form prescribed by DMV. The school is also required to remit to the department $50 for each skills test administered.\nAlthough Class A driver training schools will be able to administer the road skills exam, they cannot require that their students be tested at their driver training school.
