    "text_content": "What Is an Escort Vehicle?\nAn escort vehicle is one that is used to escort trucks with loads or convoys of vehicles. It serves as a forward or rear warning device to the general public and is required for certain over-dimensional or overweight loads. Escort vehicles are also referred to as flag or pilot cars.\nThe escort vehicle driver is responsible for the overall movement of the load. It is important to remember that the over-dimensional load driver and the escort driver function as a team. Each person must contribute his or her skills and complete attention to ensuring the safe movement of the load. Constant alertness is necessary to anticipate and avoid problems.\nReciprocity Agreements with Other States\nAs outlined in Virginia Code \u00a7\n46.2-2907\n, a Virginia certification as an escort vehicle driver is valid in states that have a reciprocity agreement with Virginia. Any escort vehicle driver certification from those states is also valid in Virginia. However, if someone from those states wants a Virginia Escort Vehicle Driver Certification (Virginia credential), he/she will have to complete the requirements as listed in Code of Virginia \u00a7\n46.2-2906\n.\nCurrently, Virginia has reciprocity agreements with the following states:\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nMinnesota\nNorth Carolina\nOklahoma\nUtah\nWashington\nEscort Vehicle Driver Training\nThe purpose of the escort vehicle and driver training is to enhance the safety of moving over-dimensional loads by highway and to reduce delays and inconveniences to the general flow of traffic.
