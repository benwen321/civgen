You must provide your certificate of completion such as a DEC-1 (from the public or private school) or DTS 36 (from a DMV-licensed driver training school) to the email address of the school that will be providing the Driver's Manual course before you enroll in the Driver's Manual Course.\nStudents age 18 or older\nmay complete an 8-hour Driver's Manual course, either in a\nclassroom or online\n. This 8-hour course is based on the Virginia driver's manual and is designed to better prepare individuals for the knowledge test. The online course must be completed through a DMV-licensed online driver training school. You can find a list of schools offering this course at Driver's Manual Course Training Sites.\nNote:\nThe completion date of the driver's manual course must be after the date of your third knowledge test failure.\nWhen you have successfully completed either the\nclassroom or online\nversion of the Driver's Manual course and have provided DMV with your certificate of completion, you can retake the general knowledge exam.\nNote:\nIf you have failed the CDL knowledge test, prior to February 7, 2022, you must complete the classroom component in person. An online version of the course is not available at this time.\nFailing the Road Skills Test\nIf you have failed the road test three times\n, you must take the behind-the-wheel component of driver education. This component consists of\nseven 50-minute periods of driving; no observation or road skills test required.\nFind a Driver Training School\nTo locate the driver training school that is closest to you, refer to\nDriver Training Schools (Three Exam Failures)\n.\nAdditional Information\nDMV is committed to promoting transportation safety through the certification of quality driver training programs.\nFor information about the laws governing driver training schools, refer to the\nVirginia Driver Training School Regulations\n.\nIf you have comments or concerns about this course, call our toll-free number: 1-877-885-5790.",
