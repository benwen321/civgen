    "text_content": "What is a Driver Privilege Card?\nThe Driver Privilege Card, authorized by the 2020 Virginia General Assembly, is a driver\u2019s license available to non-U.S. citizens. It allows Virginia residents who are not U.S. citizens to legally drive without needing to provide proof of legal presence or U.S. citizenship.\nHow Can I Determine If a Student Has a Driver Privilege Card or Permit?\nYou cannot determine whether a student holds a Driver Privilege Card (DPC) or permit. Do not attempt to assess a student\u2019s citizenship or immigration status or identify the type of credential they are applying for. Inform all students that if they have a Driver Privilege Card or permit, they must complete a road skills test administered by DMV. DMV will notify the student by mail about whether the road skills test is required.\nWhy Do Driver Privilege Card Applicants Have to Complete a DMV Road Skills Test?\nUnder Virginia law (\n\u00a7 46.2-328.3\n), individuals applying for a Driver Privilege Card are not eligible for any exemption from the driver examination. As a result, they are required to complete a road skills test administered by the DMV. This testing requirement was established when the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation creating the Driver Privilege Card during the 2020 legislative session.\nIs My Instructor Required to Administer a Road Skills Test?\nInstructors should continue administering road skills tests as usual for all students. However, DMV will inform Driver Privilege Card holders when they need to complete a final road skills test administered by the DMV.\nIf My Student Completed Driver\u2019s Education Before These Changes Became Effective, Do They Still Need a DMV Road Skills Test?\nYes, all first-time Driver Privilege Card applicants must take the DMV-administered road skills test, regardless of when they completed driver\u2019s education.\nCan I Issue a Driver Training Certificate to a Driver Privilege Card Applicant?\nYes, you can provide driver training and issue a Driver Training Certificate to Driver Privilege Card applicants, just as you would for non-DPC applicants. However, after DMV processes the certificate, the student will be notified that they must complete a road skills test at DMV.\nCan a Driver Privilege Card Applicant Use a Driver Training Certificate to Waive the Learner\u2019s Permit Holding Period?\nAdults (18 and older) can waive the learner's permit holding period with a Driver Training Certificate (DTS D). However, juvenile applicants (under 18) must still hold their learner\u2019s permit for 9 months.\nCan a Driver Privilege Card applicant with a Training Certificate and Permit Drive Without Another Licensed Driver in the Vehicle?\nNo. A Driver Training Certificate (DTS D) is not considered a temporary license. Additionally, holders of a Driver Privilege Card cannot drive alone with just a DTS B and learner's permit. They must pass a DMV-administered road skills test and obtain their full Driver Privilege Card before driving independently.\nWho Is Required to Complete Driver\u2019s Education?\nVirginia law requires all applicants under 18 to complete driver\u2019s education. Adults (18 and older) are not required to take driver\u2019s education.\nAre Applicants for a Non-DPC License Required to Take a Road Skills Test at DMV?\nNo. Applicants for a regular (non-DPC) license who complete driver\u2019s education do not need to take a separate road skills test at DMV.\nHow Will DMV Notify Applicants of These Changes?\nDMV has updated the Driver Privilege Card application (\nDL10\n) to inform applicants about the requirement for a DMV-administered road skills test. DMV is also revising website content, driver training certificates (DTSB and DTSD), and providing staff training. Once your school submits the certificate to DMV, the student will be notified by mail if a road skills test is required.\nWill DMV Send New Driver Training Certificates to Schools?\nYes, DMV is mailing updated Driver Training Certificates (DTSB and DTSD) to driver training schools. These certificates include information about the new requirements for Driver Privilege Card applicants.\nHow Can a DPC Applicant Complete the DMV Road Skills Test?\nDPC applicants can schedule an appointment or walk in during DMV office hours. Walk-in applicants must arrive by 4:30 p.m. (Monday to Friday) or by 11:30 a.m. on Saturdays to take the test that day.

The vehicle must meet the following requirements:\nValid safety inspection sticker and license plates\nRegistration card\nWorking brakes, safety belts, horn, lights, turn signals, mirrors, and speedometer\nAre Instructors Allowed to Provide Translation Services During the DMV Road Skills Test?\nYes, you may assist with translation if requested. To do so, you must provide a valid U.S. driver\u2019s license and sit in the back seat.
