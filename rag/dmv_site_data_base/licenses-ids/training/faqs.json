    "text_content": "What is an escort vehicle?\nAn escort vehicle is a vehicle used as a forward or rear warning device to the general public, required for certain over-dimensional or over weight loads, also referred to as flag or pilot cars.\nWhat is an escort vehicle driver, and what are the duties and responsibilities of the escort vehicle driver?\nThe purpose of the escort vehicle and driver is to enhance the safety of moving over-dimensional loads by highway and to reduce delays and inconveniences to the normal flow of traffic. Escort drivers have specific tasks to perform during each phase of the over-dimensional load movement.\nWhat is the purpose of requiring the eight-hour training program?\nThe training program provides a solid foundation for conducting escort vehicle operations in a safe and professional manner. Specific objectives of the program include:\nWhat are the benefits of having trained escort vehicle drivers?\nWhen properly trained, escort vehicle drivers provide benefits to all parties involved in the transportation of over-dimensional or oversized loads: the manufacturers themselves, the trucking companies transporting the load, the general motoring public, and all other drivers and pedestrians on our highways and roads.\nWhat are the requirements for getting a Virginia escort vehicle driver certification?\nVirginia Code \u00a746.2-2906 states that every person who applies for escort vehicle driver certification must meet the following requirements:\nWhat do I do once I have completed training?\nOnce you have completed the course and received your completion certificate, you can go to any Virginia DMV Customer Service Center (CSC) with your certificate and take the 50-question Escort Vehicle Driver Certification Test. You must get a score of 80% or better in order to pass the test. There is a $25.00 certificate fee that must be paid at the time the test is passed.\nWhat happens if I fail the test at DMV? Can I retake the test?\nAfter you have completed the test, a DMV customer service representative will let you know whether or not you passed. If you fail the test, you may retake it on the next business day. However, if you fail the test three times, you must wait 30 calendar days before retaking the test. We suggest you review the material presented at the training course prior to retaking the test.\nHow long does a Virginia escort vehicle driver certification last?\nThe certificate is valid for five years and will expire on the last day of the month in which it was issued. For example, if your certification was issued March 1, your certification will expire in five years on March 31st.\nWhat if I am not from Virginia, can I still get a Virginia escort vehicle driver certification?\nYes, customers with valid out-of-state driver's licenses are able to get a Virginia escort vehicle driver certification. If validity of an out state-state driver's license can be verified in our DMV offices on the National Driver Registry (NDR), a transcript from your state is not needed. However, proof of completion of an 8-hour training course is required. This training can be from Virginia or another state that has a reciprocal agreement with Virginia.\nHow do I renew my Virginia escort vehicle driver certification?\nTo renew your certification, you will have to take the escort vehicle driver certification test at a customer service center (CSC) and pay a $25 renewal fee. If the certification is expired, but expired less than one year, will have to take the escort vehicle driver certification test and pay a $25 renewal fee. If your certification has been expired for more than a year, you will have to take an 8-hour training course, pass the test and pay a $25 renewal fee.\nWhat do I do if my escort vehicle driver certification card is lost, stolen or destroyed?\nTo receive a duplicate certificate if it has been lost, stolen, destroyed, go to any Virginia DMV CSC and complete the \"Escort Vehicle Driver Certification Application\" (HP-404). Pay the $15 duplication fee and you will receive the duplicate in about two weeks. You may also contact the Hauling Permit Office at (804) 497-7135 to obtain a duplicate. Performing escort duties without a certificate is done at your own risk.\nIs the training course or test required if I am just getting a duplicate certification card or if my certification card has been stolen?\nNeither the escort driver certification test nor the 8-hour training course is required for a duplicate or reissue certification card or to change information on an existing certification card.\nIf my address changes, do I need to notify DMV?\nYou must notify the DMV within 30 days of your change of address. There is no charge to change your address unless you purchase a new driver's license with your new address on it.\nWhat causes a Virginia escort vehicle driver certification to be suspended or revoked?\nIf the escort vehicle driver's license is in good standing with the state, then the certification is valid. If the driver's license is suspended or revoked, then the certification is not valid.\nWhat equipment is required to be carried on the vehicle?\n(For the complete list and more detail, refer to the Virginia Escort Driver\u2019s Manual)\nWill anyone check escort vehicles for the proper equipment?\nDMV manages the weigh stations and our employees are trained to ensure that the truck has the proper number of escorts and that the escorts are certified with the proper equipment. The inspection stations for tunnels could do the same thing. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) runs the inspection stations prior to the tunnels and we plan an educational outreach for them as well.\nWhat is the minimum fine for an escort vehicle not having the proper equipment? Is the fine listed in the new Virginia Escort Vehicle Driver Manual?\nThe Virginia Code does not have a section that specifically imposes fines for not having the proper equipment; however, the load can be delayed until the proper equipment is obtained.\nWhy is the escort vehicle driver certification not included on the driver's license? Why is there not a picture on the escort vehicle driver certification card?\nThe Virginia driver's license is proof that a driver is able to operate a vehicle in the Commonwealth. It was decided that a separate certification card would be used to show that additional requirements for becoming an escort vehicle driver have been met.\nWhat is reciprocity with other states? How does it affect me?\nThe state of Virginia has agreements with other states with similar training programs to allow escort vehicle drivers certified in Virginia to be considered certified in those states and vice versa. This is called reciprocity and is defined in Virginia Code \u00a746.2-2907. Currently, we have an agreement with North Carolina. This allows anyone who has a valid Virginia escort vehicle driver certification to escort loads in that state.\nWill escorts with a vehicle registered in Virginia be required to be certified in Virginia?\nThe Code of Virginia focuses on Virginia residents and non-Virginia residents. Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-2901 states in part that anytime a load is being escorted the escort driver must have: a valid escort vehicle driver certificate issued by the Commonwealth or another state that has a reciprocal agreement with the Commonwealth recognizing escort vehicle driver certificates issued by that state. Additionally, Virginia Code \u00a746.2-2907 and \u00a746.2-2908 stipulate that non-Virginia residents can legally escort loads in Virginia. None of the approved language mandates a Virginia resident to obtain a Virginia escort certification. A Virginia resident could have a North Carolina certification and be legal, since North Carolina is a reciprocal state.\nWill escort vehicles be required to have commercial insurance or would a home owner umbrella meet the insurance requirement?\nVirginia Code \u00a746.2-2902 (effective January 1, 2014) states that insurance to be kept in force. Each person or company providing certified escort vehicle services shall keep in force at all times valid liability insurance coverage for those classes of insurance defined in Virginia Code \u00a738.2-117 and \u00a738.2-118 in the amount of at least $750,000 that has been issued by an insurance carrier authorized to do business in the Commonwealth.\nFor questions about the process or my Virginia escort vehicle driver certification, who do I contact?\nPlease contact DMV's Hauling Permits office at (804) 497-7135.",
