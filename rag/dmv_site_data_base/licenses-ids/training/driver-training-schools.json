    "text_content": "Driver training schools are licensed by DMV to offer driver education programs statewide to residents of all ages.\nThe program includes 36 classroom sessions, seven driving sessions, seven observation sessions and a final road skills examination. Each session is 50-minutes long.\nCompleting a driver education program gets you a completion certificate, which most new drivers need to qualify for a permanent driver's license.\nFind a Driver Training School\nRequirements to Get a License\nIf you are a Virginia resident UNDER 18 years old, before you can get your driver\u2019s license, you must hold your Virginia learner\u2019s permit for at least nine months and complete a Commonwealth of Virginia-approved driver education program.\nNew Virginia Residents with Out-of-State Permits\nIf you are a Virginia resident UNDER 18 years old and you move to Virginia from another U.S. state or territory with a valid learner\u2019s permit, the time you held your learner's permit will be counted toward the Virginia minimum holding period.\nIf, while holding your out of state learner\u2019s permit, you completed an out-of-state driver education program, the out-of-state program must provide proof you have completed at least 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of in-car instruction.\nIf you are a Virginia resident age 18 or OLDER and have never held a license issued by any state, U.S. territory or foreign country, there are two options to get your driver\u2019s license.\nOption 1\nPass the driver's license\nknowledge exam\nto be issued a learner\u2019s permit, and complete a driver education program.\nThis waives the 60-day holding period of a learner's permit. You also won\u2019t be required to take the road skills test at DMV, as the test is part of the driver education program.\nOption 2\nHold a Virginia learner's permit for at least 60 days and complete a\nBehind-the-Wheel Checklist\nbefore taking the\nroad skills test\nat DMV.\nThis waives the need for a driver education program. However, a licensed driver must certify they were with you while you practiced, and that you have complied with all requirements for learner's permit holders while operating a motor vehicle.\nHow Many Times Can I Fail the Exam?\nAdditional Information\nIf you have comments or concerns about driver training schools, call our toll-free hotline at 1-877-885-5790.\nThe program consists of 36 fifty-minute classroom periods of instructions and 14 fifty-minute periods in-car instructions (7 periods of driving and 7 periods of observation, including the final road skills examination). It includes components about alcohol safety, drug abuse awareness, aggressive driving, distracted driving, pedestrian and bicycle safety, handicapped parking, fuel efficient driving practices, motorcycle awareness and organ and tissue donation awareness.\nDMV is committed to promoting transportation safety through the certification of quality driver training programs.
