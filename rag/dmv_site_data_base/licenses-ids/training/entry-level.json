This training will take place on both a range and a public road.\nTraining Providers\nA list of acceptable training providers can be found on the federal\nTraining Provider Registry (TPR)\nwebsite.\nTraining providers must meet all federal and state requirements to provide ELDT and register with the TPR. Once a driver successfully completes the required training the training provider must electronically submit the driver-trainee's training certification information to the TPR.\nFor detailed information on becoming an ELDT provider, please see\nTraining Providers for ELDT\n.\nTraining Provider Registry\nThe Training Provider Registry (TPR) is an online system that will help CDL applicants connect with qualified training providers to get the training they need to safely operate CMVs. This system will also retain a record of the training completion and relay it as needed to state licensing agencies.\nTraining providers will submit driver training certification information to the FMCSA electronically via the TPR. Prior to administering any relevant skills or knowledge tests, DMV or an authorized third-party tester will retrieve the driver training certification information from the TPR.\nAdditional Information and Resources\nTo learn more about ELDT and the Training Provider Registry, visit\ntpr.fmcsa.dot.gov\n.\n\nCan I complete the knowledge tests for a CLP before I complete entry-level driver training?\nYes. Applicants are not required to complete ELDT prior to obtaining a CLP. However, if they are applying to add a HME to their CDL, they must complete the theory portion of ELDT prior to completing the HME knowledge test at DMV.\nWhen does entry-level driver training have to be completed?\nFor anyone applying for a HME for the first time, the Hazmat theory portion of ELDT must be completedprior to taking the Hazmat knowledge exam.\nIf I obtained a CDL before February 7, 2022, but did not obtain a school bus, passenger or hazardous materials endorsement on either my CDL or CLP before February 7, 2022, am I subject to the entry-level driver training requirements?\nYes, if you are applying to obtain the S, P, or HME endorsement for the first time, you must complete the entry-level driver training required for the endorsement.\nIf I held a Class A or B CDL and allowed it to expire or if I voluntarily surrendered it, am I required to complete ELDT to obtain a new CDL?\nNo. If you were issued a CDL before February 7, 2022, you are not subject to the ELDT requirements if you reapply for a CDL of the same class with the same endorsements, even if the previously issued CDL has expired.\nCan I complete the Hazmat knowledge or road skills test before my training provider updates the training provider registry, if I bring my certificate of completion?\nNo. DMV is not authorized to accept paper training certificates. Federal regulation requires DMV to obtain completion information electronically through the TPR.\nHow long will it take for my training provider to record my completion information to the registry?\nTraining providers are required to record completion information to the TPR within 48 hours after the training is completed. After the information is recorded in the training provider registry, it will be immediately available to DMV and authorized third-party testers.\nWhere can I find more information about the TPR and entry-level driver training requirements?\nThe TPR website can be viewed attpr.fmcsa.dot.gov.",
