    "text_content": "Clearinghouse Purpose and Usage\nThe\nDrug and Alcohol Clearinghouse\n(Clearinghouse) is a database created by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The Clearinghouse tracks violations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) drug and alcohol testing program for drivers that hold a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) or commercial learners permit (CLP). Drivers with violations are placed into a \u201cprohibited\u201d status in the Clearinghouse.\nProhibited Status and License Downgrades\nDrivers with a prohibited status in the Clearinghouse are unable to operate a commercial motor vehicle. The Clearinghouse will electronically notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) of any Clearinghouse status changes, and DMV is required to downgrade the driver's CDL or CLP to a standard license within 60 days of being notified of a prohibited status.\nAdditionally, DMV is required to check the Clearinghouse before the issuance, renewal, replacement or upgrade of a CDL privilege. Any driver with a prohibited status in the Clearinghouse is ineligible for a CDL or CLP. DMV does not have the authority to change your status, facilitate the return to duty process or remove a downgrade order in the Clearinghouse.\nThe Return to Duty Process\nThe return to duty process (RTD) is a series of steps drivers in a prohibited status must complete to regain their commercial driving privileges. This involves:\nMeeting with a Department of Transportation (DOT) qualified substance abuse professional (SAP) for an evaluation\nCompleting the educational and/or treatment programs recommended by the SAP\nSAP reevaluation and establishing a follow-up testing plan\nSuccessful completion of the Return to Duty (RTD) drug/alcohol test\nFor more information, see the\nReturn to Duty Process\n.\nSubstance Abuse Professionals\nA substance abuse professional (SAP) is an individual certified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to oversee a commercial driver\u2019s progression through the return to duty (RTD) process.\nIf a CDL/CLP holder violates FMCSA\u2019s drug and alcohol policies, the driver\u2019s employer is expected to provide the driver with a list of SAPs. The driver has the option to choose from this list or find another SAP. The driver must log into their Clearinghouse account and designate which SAP they will be using. The SAP will then begin their evaluation to determine what programs are necessary for the driver to regain commercial driving privileges.\nCompletion of the Return to Duty Process\nUpon completing the return to duty (RTD) process, the driver will be eligible to obtain their commercial driving privileges.\u00a0If the CDL has been downgraded for less than one year, the driver can resume operation of commercial vehicles, provided that any unrelated requirements imposed by DMV or a court have been resolved. If the CDL has been downgraded or surrendered for more than one year, the driver will be required to complete the CDL knowledge and road skills tests.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, please review our frequently asked questions below, the\nDACH site\u2019s FAQ\n, the\nFMCSA\u2019s Motor Carrier Safety Planner\nor\ncontact FMCSA\n.\n\nWho uses the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse?\nCommercial drivers, companies that employ commercial drivers, substance abuse professionals and government employees all make use of the clearinghouse.\nWhat is DMV\u2019s role with the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse?\nThe Clearinghouse sends data to the DMV regarding who should have their licenses downgraded.
