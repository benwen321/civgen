Certification to either an \"excepted intrastate\" or \"non-excepted intrastate\" operation will require that an Intrastate Only restriction of \"K\" be placed on the CDL or CLP.\nTo help you determine which category best fits your commercial vehicle operation, refer to\nCDL Medical Requirements Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n.\nMedical Examiner Requirement\nCDL drivers who certify to either a \"non-excepted interstate\" or \"non-excepted intrastate\" category of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operation must have their physical examiner's certificate completed by a medical examiner who is listed on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA's)\nNational Registry of Medical Examiners\n.\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will not accept your medical examiner's certificate unless it was completed by a medical examiner listed on the National Registry of Medical Examiners and the certificate displays the medical examiner's registry number.\nFor more information on how to locate a medical examiner who is on the Registry, refer to the\nNational Registry of Medical Examiners\n.\nIf Applying for an Original, Renewal, or Replacement CDL/Commercial Learner's Permit\nIf you are applying for an original, renewal, or replacement CDL/commercial learner's permit (CLP), you must certify on your application to one of the four categories of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operations listed above. Based on your certification category, you may be required to submit additional medical documentation.\nIf you certify to one of the excepted categories\n(i.e., excepted interstate or excepted intrastate), you will not have to submit any medical documentation.\nIf you certify to one of the non-excepted categories\n(i.e., non-excepted interstate or non-excepted intrastate), you must submit either a copy of your medical examiner's certificate (also known as a DOT Medical Card) OR your state approved medical variance/waiver letter. If the medical examiner's certificate indicates that you have been granted a federal waiver exemption and/or SPE, you must also submit a copy of the document(s).\nFailure to meet these conditions will cause your application to be denied.\nSubmitting Your Documentation\nPrior to submission, please make sure that the information on your medical document(s) is legible, clear and complete. If we cannot read the documentation, then we will not be able to update your record.\nDo not provide your full Medical Examination Report (MER) Form, MCSA-5875 to DMV. DMV can only accept a\nMedical Examiner's Certificate (MEC), MCSA - 5876\n, also known as a \"medical card\" or \"DOT card\". The MEC fits on a single page and includes the MEC expiration date. View a\nsample\nof the form to ensure you are providing the proper document to DMV.\nThe fastest and easiest way to have your medical document(s) processed is by submitting them online. DMV will email you after your medical document(s) have been processed. Click the \"UPLOAD ONLINE\" link below to submit your documents. It's fast, easy and secure!\nUpload Online\nIf you are unable to upload your documents online, DMV can still accept them by one of the methods listed below:\nMail\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\nCDL/NDR Work Center, room 420\nP.O. Box 27412\nRichmond, Virginia 23269\nFax\n804-367-6692\nIn Person\nVisit any\nCustomer Service Center\n(CSC)\nIf you are a trucking company submitting medical certification document(s) on behalf of your drivers, please use the submission options listed above.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, please review the\nCDL Medical Requirements Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nor\ncontact us\n.\nSee Also\nOur\nDriver Alert Program",
