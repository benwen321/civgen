    "text_content": "Through the Troops to Trucks\u2120 program, DMV is making it easier for personnel trained by the military in the operation of heavy vehicles to obtain civilian commercial driver's licenses (CDL). A commercial driver's license is required to operate large trucks and buses.\nTo find out if you qualify for the Troops to Trucks\u2120 program, complete the Troops to Trucks\u2120\nchecklist\n.
