    "text_content": "Anyone applying for or renewing a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) with a hazardous materials endorsement (HME) must meet federal requirements issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).\nRequirements\nTo receive or renew an HME, all applicants must:\n1.\nPass the\nhazardous materials (HAZMAT) knowledge exam\n.\nNote: First time applicants must complete\nEntry Level Driver Training\nbefore taking the HAZMAT knowledge exam.\n2.\u00a0Provide\nacceptable documentation\nshowing proof of U.S. citizenship or immigration status.\n3.\nComplete a\u00a0fingerprint-based background check\u00a0at one of the DMV\ncustomer service centers\nequipped to process your application. There is a non-refundable $83 fee.\n*Save time by completing the\nBackground Check Application\nbefore your appointment.\nMake an Appointment\nTWIC Card Holders\nYou are exempt from the fingerprint-based background check\u00a0if you hold a valid\nTransportation Worker's Identification Credential (TWIC)\n, and the TWIC can be verified by DMV when submitted with your HME application.\nIf you apply for a HME using TWIC comparability, the HME expiration date will expire no later than the current expiration date of the TWIC. The non-refundable reduced fee is $41. You may visit any DMV\ncustomer service center\nto process your reduced fee application.\nWhat is TWIC comparability?\nTWIC comparability means the TSA has determined that the security threat assessments (fingerprinting and background check) performed on applicants for a TWIC are comparable to those performed on applicants for the HME. As a result, TSA exempts HME applicants from the background and fingerprint check if a valid TWIC card is submitted with the HME application.\nOut-of-State CDL Holders\nIf you are transferring a CDL with an HME from another state, you will receive an HME on your Virginia CDL if:\nYou currently hold the endorsement on your out-of-state CDL\nDMV can verify your eligibility with your current state\nYou pass the HAZMAT knowledge test in Virginia\nIf you have not completed a TSA-based background and fingerprint check in your current state, or your eligibility cannot be verified by DMV, you may be issued a Virginia CDL with an HME\nONLY IF you apply for and pass the\u00a0fingerprint-based background check and HAZMAT knowledge test in Virginia.\nProcessing the Application\nDMV sends your application information to TSA, which will perform background checks, make security assessments and notify us whether the application is approved or denied.\nThe\u00a0fingerprint-based background check\u00a0is valid for up to five years.\nIf approved, DMV will send you a letter of approval. You may then return to DMV to be photographed and apply for your CDL with the HME, provided you have successfully completed the HAZMAT knowledge test.\nIf denied, DMV will send you a notification of denial by TSA.\nHME Renewal\nDMV will mail you a renewal notice approximately 90 days before your HME expiration date. It's important to begin the renewal process at this time so TSA can approve you before your HME expires.\nRemoving Your HME\nIf you do not intend to keep your HME, visit any customer service center\nBEFORE your HME expires\n. This will allow your CDL to be reissued or renewed without the HME. If the HME expires before you remove it, your CDL will be canceled until you remove the HME.\nMake an Appointment",
