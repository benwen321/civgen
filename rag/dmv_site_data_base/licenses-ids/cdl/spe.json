    "text_content": "Definition\nThe Skill Performance Evaluation Certificate program (SPE) is a federally sponsored program available to drivers with certain physical limitations affecting their ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle. The program allows drivers of commercial vehicles (CDL drivers) with missing or impaired limbs to drive commercial vehicles across state lines, provided that they have been fitted with and wear the correct prosthetic device and can demonstrate driving competency.\nSPE Certificates Issued by DMV\nThe Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles has been granted permission to issue federal SPE certificates. CDL drivers licensed in Virginia and subject to the Federal SPE requirements under \u00a7\n49 CFR 391.49\ncan fulfill the Federal requirements with a SPE certificate issued by DMV. The state-issued SPE will be based on standards, processes and procedures comparable to those used by FMCSA. The State will maintain copies of all evaluation forms and certificates issued to enable FMCSA to conduct periodic reviews of the program. Virginia licensed CDL drivers who receive the State issued SPE are allowed to drive commercial motor vehicles anywhere in the United States.\nFor more information on the SPE Certification Program, refer to\nFMCSA - Skill Performance Evaluation Certificate Program\n.\nApplication Form\nSkill Performance Evaluation Certificate Application (\nMED 13\n)\nApplication Process\nObtain the application online (\nMED 13\n) or at a\ncustomer service center\n.\nSubmit the application at a customer service center or by mail to:\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\nMedical Review Services\nPO Box 27412\nRichmond, VA 23269-0001",
