    "text_content": "DMV has taken numerous measures to ensure our customer service centers (CSC) comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that our disabled customers have access to the services they need in a comfortable environment.\nCustomers with disabilities can easily request special assistance or accommodations by making their needs known when they arrive at the information counter in any CSC. Once a customer's special needs are identified, a customer service representative will assist the customer with his or her transactions, including the completion of forms or testing. If a special needs person requests to take the driver's exam, managers will work with that person to find an appropriate testing environment.",
