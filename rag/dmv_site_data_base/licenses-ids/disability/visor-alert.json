    "text_content": "Visor Alert is a joint program between the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Virginia Department for the Deaf and the Hard of Hearing (DDHH). The program provides visor and wallet cards to help ease communication problems between police officers and people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nThe visor cards reduce misunderstanding and confusion between a police officer and a hearing impaired driver during a traffic stop or other encounter. The officer realizes that the individual has special communication needs due to hearing loss and is not intentionally failing to respond to their request. The card provides communication strategies for the officer, along with images of common traffic situations.\nUsing the Visor Alert Card\nThe visor alert card should be attached to the driver's sun visor with a binder clip or elastic bands.\nWhen the officer approaches during a traffic stop, the motorist should:\nLower the sun visor\nPoint to the visor card and then to their ear\nHand the card to the police officer\nKeep their hands on the steering wheel until the officer has had a chance to read the card.\nObtaining a Visor Alert Card\nTo obtain a Visor Alert card, contact either:\nA\nDDHH Outreach Specialist\n, or\nThe DDHH central office by email at\nfrontdsk@DDHH.virginia.gov\nor by telephone at 804-662-9502 (1-800-552-7917 toll free).\nVisor Card Sample Images",
