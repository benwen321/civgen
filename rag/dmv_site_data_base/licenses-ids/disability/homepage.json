Providing superior service is important to us. If we can help, please let us know.\nParking for Customers with Disabilities\nDMV offers several different\nparking placards and plates\nfor customers with disabilities.\nAssistance for Customers with Disabilities\nCustomers with disabilities can easily request special assistance or accommodations by making their needs known when they arrive at the information counter in any CSC. A customer service representative will assist the customer with their transactions, including the completion of forms or testing, and can work with the customer to find a suitable testing environment as needed.\nCustomers with Hearing Impairments\nUbiDuo Device\nIf a customer is hearing impaired, a wireless electronic device, called UbiDuo, is available by request at the information desk. UbiDuo consists of two small screens with attached keyboards that communicate directly with each other. This allows a customer and an employee to communicate across the service counter by typing a conversation in real time.\nInterpreter Services\nArrangements can also be made for an interpreter to assist during the transaction. The Virginia Department of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (VDDHH) provides interpreters free of charge to DMV customers. Either the customer or a DMV employee can contact VDDHH at (804) 662-9502 to set up an appointment at DMV for the customer and interpreter.\nIdentification cards\nfor customers who are hearing impaired are available from any DMV office.\nThe\nVisor Alert\nprogram issues visor and wallet cards to hearing impaired drivers to help these drivers and police officers to communicate more effectively with each other.\nMedical Indicators on Driver\u2019s Licenses\nVirginia driver's license applicants may request that one or more medical indicators be placed on their license. A signed statement from a licensed physician, confirming the medical condition, will need to be presented.\nMedical indicator codes appear on the front of a driver\u2019s license under the word \u201drestrictions\u201d to identify the disability to law enforcement. The code is defined on the back of the license.\nResources\nVisor Alert Card\nHearing Impaired ID Card",
