    "text_content": "Show your organization's commitment to highway safety by enrolling in DMV's enhanced Driver Alert program. Driver Alert gives employers the opportunity to customize the information DMV sends related to changes to employees' driving records.\nBy enrolling in Driver Alert, you can request:\nImmediate alerts of moving violation convictions\nImmediate alerts if drivers accumulate seven adverse points within a calendar year\nImmediate alert of suspensions, revocations, cancellations (e.g. resulting from HAZMAT endorsement expiration, CDL medical certificate expiration), disqualifications, reckless driving, or driving while intoxicated convictions\nThe month and day you wish to receive annual risk management driver records - required for companies who employ drivers with commercial driver's licenses (CDL)\nHow It Works\nEmployers provide DMV with a list of drivers electronically and can add or delete drivers as needed. If a driver does not hold a CDL or is not required to hold a CDL as a condition of employment, employers must obtain permission from the employee to receive a copy of their driving record.\nParticipants are billed $10 for each driving record that is generated. If none of your employees have convictions, there is no additional charge. When a conviction hits a record, notification is sent to the employer the following day.\nEnroll in Driver Alert\nYou may apply to participate in the Driver Alert program by downloading\neither a Commercial Information Use Agreement Application (\nUS-532A\n)\n(non-governmental entities)\nor a Government Information Use Agreement Application (\nUS-532B\n) (\ngovernmental entities)\nAND\nan Application for Extranet Transaction Access (\nUS-532E/ER\n).\nSubmit your completed application electronically to\nuseagreement@dmv.virginia.gov\nor fax to (804) 367-2536.

DMV will collect a $65 fee to establish login credentials for each user on your account (all applicants).\nAdditional Information\nDriver Alert is an efficient, cost-effective way for your organization to ensure that your employees are safe, qualified drivers, and positively promotes your commitment to highway safety.
