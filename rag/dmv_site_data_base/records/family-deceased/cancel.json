    "text_content": "Relatives and friends of deceased individuals who held disabled parking placards or plates should return the placards or plates to their local\nDMV customer service center\n.\nRelatives may exchange disabled plates for plates without disabled parking privileges at no fee. All unreturned placards become invalid 30 days following DMV's notification and cannot be used.\nIf you are unable to locate the placard, send a letter to DMV explaining that the placard has been lost. This will ensure that the assigned number is removed from the deceased's records. Placards may be returned by mail to:\nVirginia Department of Motor Vehicles\nData Integrity Work Center\nP.O. Box 27412\nRichmond, Virginia 23269-0001",
