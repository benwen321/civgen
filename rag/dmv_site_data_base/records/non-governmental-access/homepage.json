This statute stipulates that all DMV records are privileged and are not available to the general public. DMV may only release driver, vehicle and personal information from our records under the conditions specified in the statutes mentioned above.\nThe information obtained can be used only for the purpose for which it was originally released. Companies cannot share DMV records or the information contained in DMV records without specific authorization to do so.\nIf you are not sure if you are eligible to gain access to DMV records, please\ne-mail\nus. Describe the kind of access that you are interested in, and we can let you know if you are eligible.\nApplying for Access\nNon-governmental entities may apply for electronic access to DMV records by downloading a Commercial Information Use Agreement Application (\nUS 532A\n) and an Application for Extranet Transaction Access (\nUS 532E\n).

Okta multi-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity when they sign into the extranet.\nEmail or fax your completed Commercial Information Use Agreement Application (\nUS 532A\n) and Application for Extranet Transaction Access (\nUS 532E\n).
