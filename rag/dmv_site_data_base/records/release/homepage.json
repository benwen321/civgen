Code \u00a7\n46.2-208\n.\nVa. Code \u00a7\n2.2-3801\nstates that personal information includes:\nData that describes, locates or indexes anything about an individual including, but not limited to, their Social Security number, driver's license number, agency-issued identification number, student identification number, real or personal property holdings derived from tax returns, and their education, financial transactions, medical history, ancestry, religion, political ideology, criminal or employment record.\nData that affords a basis for inferring personal characteristics of the individual, such as finger and voice prints, photographs, or things done by or to such individual; and the record of their presence, registration, or membership in an organization or activity, or admission to an institution.\nRelease of DMV Information\nDMV only releases customer information when permitted or mandated by the federal and state laws cited above.\nReleasing data stored in DMV databases provides many benefits to consumers, such as:\nEnabling manufacturers to identify customers with recalled vehicles\nHelping employees seeking driving-related job positions\nHelping customers requesting insurance quotes to demonstrate their safe driving record\nAssisting prospective purchasers by developing vehicle history reports\nWhen DMV May Share Information\nUnder the law, DMV may share data for the limited purposes listed here.\nFor use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft, performance monitoring of motor vehicles and dealers by motor vehicle manufacturers, motor vehicle emissions, motor vehicle product alterations, recalls or advisories. This provision is mandatory, and DMV must release information for these purposes.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a72721(b)\n;\nVa. Code \u00a7 46.2-209\n.\nFor use by any government agency, including any court or law enforcement agency, in carrying out its functions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(1). Under the Virginia law, DMV may refuse to release data to a government entity if the entity does not establish sufficient authority to show that the purpose for which the information will be used is one of the requester's official functions. Va. Code \u00a7\n46.2-208(B)(9)\n.\nFor use in connection with motor vehicle market research activities, including survey research. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(5); Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-209. Data released under this provision\nmay not\nbe used for the solicitation of sales.\nTo the data subject, his guardian or authorized agent, or to the parent of a minor child. In addition, vehicle information may be released to the vehicle owner. Va. Code 46.2-208(B)(4).\nTo verify or correct the accuracy of information provided by a business for use in the conduct of its business. Personal information released under this provision may be used\nonly\nfor the purpose of pursuing remedies that require locating an individual. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(3); Va.

Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(9).\nFor use by any insurer or insurance support organization, or by a self-insured entity, or its agents, employees, or contractors, in connection with claims investigation activities, antifraud activities, rating or underwriting. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(6); Va. Code 46.2-208(B)(5); Va. Code 46.2-208(B)(18).\nVehicle information may be released to a business organization, without personal information, upon written request. Va. Code 46.2-208(B)(7).\nFor use in providing notice to the owners of towed or impounded vehicles. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(7); Va.

The Virginia law narrows this provision further by requiring that the compliance agent be licensed by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and limits release to the name and address of a vehicle owner. Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(20).\nTo obtain driving information of license holders by employers and prospective employers. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(9); Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(11). Employees and prospective employees who do not hold a commercial driver's license must provide consent prior to DMV releasing any driving data.\nFor certain identified charitable organizations to obtain driving information for volunteers with the consent of the individual. Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(12) through Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(14).\nFor use in connection with the operation of toll facilities, traffic light photo-monitoring systems, video monitoring systems or photo speed monitoring, DMV may release vehicle owner information. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72721 (b)(10); Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(21); Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(31); Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B)(32).\nMedical information may\nonly\nbe released to a physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner in accordance with a proceeding under Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7\n46.2-321\nand\n46.2-322\n.\nDriving information may be shared with motor vehicle rental and leasing companies. Va.

Code 46.2-208(B)(17).\nInformation That May Not Be Shared\nWithout a court order, DMV may not share the following data with any entity other than the data subject or their representative:\nProof documents that customers present to get a driver's license or identification card.\nThe indicator within DMV's records reflecting the type of proof documents presented to get a DMV credential, except when needed for voter registration purposes under Va. Code \u00a7\n46.2-208.1\n.\nThe application customers fill out to get a DMV credential.\nBulk release of photographs. While government entities and law enforcement may request individual photographs for official use under Va. Code 46.2-208(B)(9), DMV may not allow access to all photographs for search purposes to any entity.\nMethods of Data Release\nWork units within DMV are responsible for reviewing any request for data and determining if the requester is entitled to the information under the law. If a statutory exception permits the requester to receive DMV data, there are multiple ways that data may be securely transmitted.\nCustomers making small or individual requests may get records by mail. The requester will be required to provide the reason for the request and certify the information they provide DMV is true and accurate. The most common method of individual data requests is through the\nInformation Request form\n.\nDMV will not routinely email customer information to a requester, as regular email is not a secure method to release DMV records containing personal information. DMV does, however, have access to a secure electronic mail service that may be used upon request.\nData requesters seeking information from DMV's records on a regular basis must enter into a use agreement with DMV before getting electronic access to customer information. This agreement creates the binding terms under which the requester may access data, including limiting use of the data to the permissible purpose under the law which allows the requester to receive the data.\nEntities electronically accessing DMV's records must maintain sufficient protections to meet the DMV and Commonwealth information technology security requirements.\nRequest a DMV Use Agreement for Non-Government Use\nRequest a DMV Use Agreement for Government Use\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nFOIA, Va. Code \u00a7\n2.2-3700\n, et seq., identifies the circumstances under which a public body like DMV must produce records in response to a request.\nVirginia Code \u00a7\n2.2-3704\nstates all public records are open to the citizens of the Commonwealth \"except as otherwise specifically provided by law.\" Pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(A), all records containing personal, driver or vehicle information are considered privileged. DMV is not permitted to release such confidential information except in certain situations enumerated in Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(B).\nIn other words, data that is protected by the privacy laws described above may not be obtained by submitting a FOIA request to DMV.\nData Brokers\nA data broker is an entity that purchases and aggregates data from multiple sources for various end purposes.\nDMV may not release customer data to a data broker for the purpose of the data broker aggregating and reselling the data for profit. As described above, DMV may not release any information from the agency's customer records without the requester establishing they have a permissible purpose under the law to receive and use the data.\nDMV may not release data to be used solely for marketing purposes.\nThe privacy laws and DMV's procedures allow entities entitled to receive DMV data to do so using an authorized agent. The agent serves as a facilitator between DMV and the entity permitted to access DMV data, and the agent may not use the data for any other purpose. The agent is required to enter into an agreement with DMV, which restricts use of the data to the end user's authorized purpose. DMV refers to these agents as third-party service providers.\nDMV Controls\nDMV recognizes that its obligation to protect customer data goes beyond requiring legal agreements to govern the requester's use of DMV data. DMV serves as the gatekeeper for our customers' records and takes that responsibility seriously. As such, the following protections are in place even after data is released to an authorized requester.\nTracking and Monitoring\nEvery time data is released from the customer database, DMV makes a notation in the individual's customer record to reflect what data was released, to whom, and for what purpose. Pursuant to the use agreement, entities electronically receiving DMV data must provide an explanation to DMV for each customer access upon request. The use agreement holder is also required to keep records to establish that each access was made for a permissible purpose for three years. DMV customers have the right to review information relating to the access of their records. DMV is in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3800, et seq.\nTraining\nDMV requires annual information technology security training for all of its employees and all individual users who have secure credentials to electronically access DMV's records. The training provides guidance on the proper ways to access DMV information in the course of business and explains the consequences of misuse and unauthorized access to DMV records. All DMV employees and data recipients are made aware of DMV's zero tolerance policy for accessing customer data without an authorized business purpose.\nAudit\nDMV's use agreements contain legal provisions that permit the agency to audit any recipient of DMV data at any time to ensure proper use of DMV's systems and information. DMV's Data Audit and Compliance work center is responsible for conducting onsite and paper-based audits of the entities who have permissible access to DMV's records to ensure all security and legal requirements are met. Entities that are found to be in violation of the DMV use agreement are subject to termination of their access to DMV records.\nUnauthorized Access\nAlthough DMV has taken extensive steps to protect customer data from breach, misuse or fraud, it is possible that an unauthorized access may occur. DMV has an internal incident response protocol to ensure that immediate action is taken to terminate any unauthorized use, mitigate damage and notify affected parties.\nPursuant to Va. Code \u00a7\n18.2-186.6\n, DMV must notify the individual whose data has been accessed, as well as the Office of the Attorney General, in the event that a customer record is viewed without a permissible business reason.\nRevenue for Data Release\nDMV is often asked by customers why the agency \"sells customer information.\"\nPursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-208(C) and Va. Code \u00a7\n46.2-214\n, DMV may \"make a reasonable charge\" for providing information from the Department's records. The Driver's Privacy Protection Act also permits state motor vehicle authorities to charge an administrative fee for releasing data. Data released to government entities must be provided free of charge if the data will be used for official purposes, and the entity does not charge DMV for data.\nIt is important to note, however, that\nDMV may not release customer data for the purpose of receiving a fee or raising revenue\n. DMV's authority to release data is controlled by the privacy statutes noted above, and no customer data may be released unless the requester meets the requirements set forth in the law.\nWhile charging a fee for the production of data is authorized by both federal and state law, the revenue is used to cover the costs of accurately and securely maintaining the information and DMV's systems.\nDMV incurs costs in the form of staffing and overhead relating to creating and updating the records, system programming, and information technology security and maintenance. DMV's data management department consists of over 40 individuals charged with reviewing, executing and renewing data use agreements, reviewing and maintaining the integrity of customer data, responding to customer requests for information, and auditing data use customers to ensure compliance with all contractual provisions. The Data Compliance and Audit work unit travels to data use customer locations to review processes and perform audits.\nDMV also maintains a staff of information security specialists to protect DMV customer information from external or internal threats.\nFinally, DMV incurs mainframe costs associated with maintaining and searching data through the state's information technology network.\nDMV Customer Records Fees",
