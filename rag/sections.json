The proceeds shall be applied to the\nsatisfaction of the debt and expenses of sale, and the surplus, if any, shall be paid within 30 days\nof the sale to any lienholder of record, and then to the owner of the vehicle, provided such\nlienholder or owner contacts the bailee prior to the sale to claim any surplus that may result. If\nsuch claim is made by the lienholder or owner within 30 days following the sale, the surplus shall\nbe paid within 30 days of the claim. If no claim to the surplus is made within 30 days of the sale,\nor if the owner or lienholder cannot be ascertained by the Department, the bailee shall be\nentitled to keep the surplus.\n\u00a0 \nC. Before any lien may be enforced under this section, the bailee or his authorized agent shall\ninitiate with the Department, in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner, a search for the\nowner and lienholder of record for the vehicle, the names and addresses of which if found shall\nbe provided to the bailee. Any bailee or authorized agent who initiates more than five such\nrequests within any 12-month period shall enter into an agreement with the Department to\ninitiate requests and receive responses electronically.\n\u00a0 \nThe Department shall check (i) its own records, (ii) the records of a nationally recognized crime\ndatabase, and (iii) records of a nationally recognized motor vehicle title database for owner and\nlienholder information. If a vehicle has been reported stolen, the Department shall notify the\nappropriate law-enforcement agency of that fact. If a vehicle is found to have been titled in\nanother jurisdiction, the Department shall contact that jurisdiction to ascertain the requested\ninformation and provide it to the bailee. At the time of the search, the Department shall also\ndetermine the value of the vehicle, using the trade-in value specified in a recognized pricing\nguide, and, for a vehicle titled in the Commonwealth, whether the records of the Department\nshow that the owner of the vehicle has indicated that he is on active military duty or service. The\nDepartment shall include such information in the response to the request for vehicle\ninformation.\n\u00a0 \nAfter responding to the request for vehicle information, the Department shall notify the owner\nand any lienholder of record of the request by first-class mail to the address provided on the\nvehicle record held by the Department or by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is titled. Such\nnotice shall include the name and contact information of the bailee and any terms for reclaiming\nthe vehicle, as well as any additional information the Commissioner determines to be necessary.\n\u00a0 \nNo notice by the Department shall be required if no record for the vehicle can be found or, in the\ncase of a vehicle titled in another jurisdiction, the other jurisdiction refuses to release the\nrequested vehicle information to the Department. In either situation, the bailee may continue\nwith lien enforcement under this section. However, if a vehicle record exists in another\njurisdiction, the bailee shall assume all liability for proceeding with such enforcement without\nwritten notice to the owner and/or lienholder of record.\u00a0 \nFor every vehicle subject to a record search as provided for in this section, if the record for the\nvehicle is held by the Department, the Department shall place an administrative hold on the\nvehicle record until the bailee reports to the Department that the vehicle has been reclaimed or\nsold pursuant to this section.\u00a0 \nD. Any bailee enforcing a lien in accordance with this section shall notify the Department of his\nintent to sell the vehicle in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. A $40 fee shall be paid to\nthe Department at the time of notice. Upon receipt of such notice and fee, the Department shall\n32 2/4/2025 12:00:00 AM\nrepeat the vehicle record search prescribed in subsection A for the purpose of confirming the\nmost recent owner and lienholder information for the vehicle.\n\u00a0 \nIf the Department confirms owner or lienholder information, either through a search of its own\nrecords or those of another jurisdiction, the Department shall notify the owner, at the last known\naddress of record, and any lienholder, at the last known address of record, of the intent to sell the\nvehicle, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and advise them to reclaim the vehicle and\nrepay the debt owed within 15 days from the date the notice was sent. Such notice, when sent in\naccordance with these requirements, shall be sufficient regardless of whether or not it was ever\nreceived.\n\u00a0 \nFollowing the notice required in this subsection, if the vehicle remains unclaimed and the debt\nunpaid, the owner and all persons having security interest shall have waived all right, title, and\ninterest in the vehicle, except to the extent that subsection B requires a surplus to be paid. The\nbailee shall notify the Department in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner within five\nbusiness days if the vehicle is reclaimed and the debt paid. Should the bailee fail to notify the\nDepartment as required herein, and the Department must remove the administrative hold placed\nunder subsection C at the request of the vehicle owner or lienholder, and upon submission of\nproof that the debt was paid and the vehicle reclaimed, the Department may impose and collect\nan administrative fee of $40 from the bailee for each such removal.\n\u00a0 \nE. At the time the bailee notifies the Department of his intent to sell the motor vehicle, the bailee\nshall provide the intended date of sale at public auction, including the time, place, and terms of\nsuch sale. The intended date shall be at least 21 days after the date of notification. The\nDepartment shall post notice on behalf of the bailee for at least 21 days prior to the date of sale,\nadvertising the time, place, and terms of the sale. Such 21-day posting period shall run\nconcurrently with the 15-day reclamation period provided for in subsection D. Notifications and\npostings shall be in an electronic manner prescribed by the Commissioner and shall include the\nvehicle identification number and a description of each vehicle to be sold. No other postings or\nnotices advertising the sale shall be required.\n\u00a0 \nUpon notice by the bailee that the vehicle will be sold, the Department shall provide a\ncertification document in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner to the bailee. The bailee\nshall complete all applicable certification statements on the document and provide it to the\nbuyer of the vehicle, who shall submit the document and an application to the Department in\norder to obtain a certificate of title for the vehicle. Upon receipt of a completed application and\ncertification document, the Department shall issue a certificate of title to the buyer or a\nnonrepairable certificate, if requested, free of all prior liens and claims of ownership of others.\u00a0 \nF. If the value of the vehicle is more than $12,500 but does not exceed $25,000, the bailee, after\nthe notice is sent by the Department pursuant to subsection C, may apply by petition to any\ngeneral district court of the county or city wherein the vehicle is, or, if the value of the vehicle\nexceeds $25,000, to the circuit court of the county or city, for the sale of the vehicle. No notice\nsent by the Department pursuant to this section shall substitute for service of process for any\ncourt proceeding. If the name of the owner cannot be ascertained, the name \"John Doe\" shall be\nsubstituted in any proceeding pursuant to this section.\u00a0 \nIf, on the hearing of the case on the petition, the defense, if any made thereto, and such evidence\nas may be adduced by the parties respectively, the court is satisfied that the debt and lien are\nestablished and the vehicle should be sold to pay the debt, the court shall order the sale to be\n33 2/4/2025 12:00:00 AM\nmade by the sheriff of the county or city. The sheriff shall make the same and apply and dispose\nof the proceeds in the same manner as if the sale were made under a writ of fieri facias. No\nadditional notifications or postings by the Department related to the sale shall be required.\n\u00a0 \nIf a court has ordered the sale of the vehicle, the bailee shall submit to the Department a copy of\nthe court order in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Upon receipt, the Department shall\nprovide a certification document to the bailee. The bailee and sheriff conducting the sale, or his\nauthorized representative, shall complete all applicable certification statements on the\ndocument and provide it to the buyer of the vehicle, who shall submit the document and an\napplication to the Department in order to obtain a certificate of title for the vehicle. Upon receipt\nof a completed application and certification document, the Department shall issue a certificate of\ntitle to the buyer or a nonrepairable certificate, if requested, free of all prior liens and claims of\nownership of others.\n\u00a0 \nG. In determining the value of the property as required by this section, the Commissioner shall\nuse a recognized pricing guide and, in using such guide, shall use the trade-in value specified in\nsuch guide.\n\u00a0 \nHowever, the bailee may submit an independent appraisal and supporting documentation to\nshow the accurate value of the vehicle in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Upon\nreceipt, the Department shall update the vehicle record to reflect the value established by the\nindependent appraisal and notify the bailee that enforcement under this section may proceed\nbased on the new value.\n\u00a0 \nIf the Department is unable to determine a trade-in value for a vehicle, the Commissioner may\nestablish guidelines for acceptable alternate valuation options to include independent appraisals\nand retail or loan values that may be available in online or printed pricing guides. The bailee may\nsubmit documentation pursuant to such guidelines in order to establish the value of the vehicle.\n\u00a0 \nH. For a vehicle (i) for which neither the owner nor any other lienholder or secured party can be\ndetermined by the Department through a diligent search as required by this section, (ii)\nmanufactured for a model year at least six years prior to the current model year, and (iii) having a\nvalue of no more than $4,500 as determined by the provisions of this section, a bailee may, after\nshowing proof that the vehicle has been in his continuous custody for at least 30 days, apply for\nand receive from the Department of Motor Vehicles title or a nonrepairable certificate to such\nvehicle, free of all liens and claims of ownership of others, and proceed to sell or otherwise\ndispose of the vehicle.\u00a0 \nI. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, a bailee shall comply with the provisions of\nthe federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901 et seq.) (the Act) when disposing of\na vehicle owned by a member of the military on active duty or service. If the records of the\nDepartment show that the owner of the vehicle has indicated to the Department that he is on\nactive military duty or service, such indicator shall be prima facie evidence that the vehicle is\nsubject to the provisions of the Act. However, neither the presence nor absence of such indicator\non the vehicle record shall absolve the bailee of his obligation to ascertain the owner's military\nservice status, if any, in accordance with the Act.\u00a0 \nJ. All fees imposed and collected pursuant to this section shall be paid into the state treasury and\nset aside as a special, nonreverting fund to be used to meet the expenses of the Department.\u00a0 \nK. Residents or businesses of other jurisdictions in possession of vehicles titled in the\n34 2/4/2025 12:00:00 AM\nCommonwealth, or the authorized agents of such residents or businesses, seeking to enforce laws\nin those jurisdictions that are substantially similar to the enforcement of liens under \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-\n644.01 and 46.2-644.02 may request information for such vehicles from the Department. The\nDepartment shall conduct the information search as provided for in subsection C, provide the\nnames and addresses of the owner and lienholder, if any, for each vehicle to the requester, and\nnotify the named owner and lienholder, if any, by first-class mail of the request. Such\nnotification shall not replace any notification requirements imposed by the jurisdiction in which\nthe requester and subject vehicle are located, nor shall the enforcement rules of this section\napply to vehicles not located within the Commonwealth. If the Department finds that the vehicle\nis titled in another jurisdiction, the Department shall identify that jurisdiction to the requester\nwith no further obligation to the requester or vehicle owner. The Department shall collect a $25\nfee for such search.\n\u00a0 \n2009, c. 664;2011, cc. 14, 702;2014, c. 339;2015, c. 640;2016, c. 397;2019, c. 560;2021, Sp. Sess. I,\nc. 374."
