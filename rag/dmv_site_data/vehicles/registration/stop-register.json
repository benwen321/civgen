    "text_content": "The General Assembly passed legislation regarding the initial vehicle registration of vehicles by those with delinquent taxes or fees, including local vehicle license fees, delinquent tangible personal property tax or parking citations. People with delinquent taxes or fees may receive a \u201cstop.\u201d A stop restricts access to the driver and vehicle records, prohibiting transactions until the issue has been resolved.\nDMV issued a limited initial registration for a period of\nup to 90 days\nfor a vehicle purchased after a stop is placed by a locality for delinquent taxes or fees. This allows customers to purchase a vehicle but grants time to satisfy delinquent taxes or fees. Once the taxes or fees are satisfied, DMV may issue a full one, two, or three year registration. This legislation does not change how DMV handles registration renewal. Customers with stops for delinquent taxes or fees are still not allowed to renew or transfer a vehicle registration.",
