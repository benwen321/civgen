This is a result of the Vehicle Registration Withholding program in which the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) assists government entities in collecting delinquent revenue.\nDMV will notify you by mail if it has received notification from another entity that you have outstanding payments due. It is your responsibility to contact the entity that reported the outstanding amount, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nOne-Month Registration Extension\nIf needed, a one-time, one-month registration extension may be requested in person at a DMV\ncustomer service center\nor\nDMV Select\nlocation. This extension will allow you to drive legally for one additional month, while you satisfy the requirements of the locality. A $10 administrative fee will be charged for the extension and prorated registration fees will be collected for the one-month registration period. In order to be eligible, your vehicle registration must be valid and due to expire within the current calendar month.\nPersonal Property Taxes and Vehicle Licensing Fees\nIf you have been reported as having delinquent tangible personal property taxes or unpaid local vehicle licensing fees, your city, county, or town can prevent the reissuance or renewal of registrations for all vehicles you own and co-own. If you are affected, it is your responsibility to contact the local Treasurer or Director of Finance that reported the delinquent account to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nParking Tickets\nIf you have unpaid parking tickets, localities can prevent the reissuance or renewal of registration for the vehicle that incurred the citation. If you are affected, it is your responsibility to contact the locality that reported the unpaid citations to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.\nToll Violations\nIf you have received an invoice for two or more unpaid tolls, toll facility operators can restrict the reissuance or renewal of registration for the vehicle involved in the toll violation.\nNot operating your vehicle at time of offense?\nAs the registered owner of the vehicle, it is your responsibility to contest liability if you were not operating the vehicle at the time of offense. If you fail to pay the unpaid tolls and administrative fees or fail to file a notice to contest liability, the toll facility operator can prevent reissuance or renewal of the vehicle registration.\nNot the owner of the vehicle at time of offense?\nIf you were driving a vehicle you did not own when you committed the offense, the registered owner of the vehicle can contest liability. In this case, you may have been reported as the driver of the vehicle when the offense was committed. If the tolls and fees remain unpaid and you have been identified by the court as the driver of the vehicle, you will not be reissued or allowed renewal of registrations for all vehicles you own and co-own.\nIf you are affected by this program, it is your responsibility to contact the\ntoll facility\noperator that reported the unpaid tolls to pay the amount due, before you can renew your decals with DMV.",
