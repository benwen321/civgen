You will be eligible for email or text notifications for future renewals if the requirements are met.\nCan all owners of a vehicle sign up for e-notifications for that vehicle?\nAny owner listed on the vehicle registration card can sign up for e-notifications. If all owners sign up, no paper notices for the vehicle will be sent, and all owners will receive email or text notifications.\nHow can I determine the carrier for my text notifications?\nThe carrier is the company that provides your cell phone service. Examples include Sprint, Verizon, etc. If you do not see your carrier in the drop-down box, please\ncontact us\n.",
